A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies, and autoimmune disorders.\\nIn humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person\\'s perspective on life.\\nDeath due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections.[3] In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\\nPathology, the study of disease, includes etiology, or the study of cause.\\n\\n\\nTerminology[edit]\\nConcepts[edit]\\nIn many cases, terms such as disease, disorder, morbidity, sickness and illness are used interchangeably; however, there are situations when specific terms are considered preferable.[4]\\n\\nDisease\\nThe term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body. For this reason, diseases are associated with the dysfunction of the body\\'s normal homeostatic processes.[5] Commonly, the term is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases, which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and aberrant proteins known as prions. An infection or colonization that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning, such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut, or of a passenger virus, is not considered a disease. By contrast, an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period, but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered a disease. Non-infectious diseases are all other diseases, including most forms of cancer, heart disease, and genetic disease.\\nAcquired disease\\nAn acquired disease is one that began at some point during one\\'s lifetime, as opposed to disease that was already present at birth, which is congenital disease. Acquired sounds like it could mean \"caught via contagion\", but it simply means acquired sometime after birth. It also sounds like it could imply secondary disease, but acquired disease can be primary disease.\\nAcute disease\\nAn acute disease is one of a short-term nature (acute); the term sometimes also connotes a fulminant nature\\nChronic condition or chronic disease\\nA chronic disease is one that persists over time, often for at least six months, but may also include illnesses that are expected to last for the entirety of one\\'s natural life.\\nCongenital disorder or congenital disease\\nA congenital disorder is one that is present at birth. It is often a genetic disease or disorder and can be inherited. It can also be the result of a vertically transmitted infection from the mother, such as HIV/AIDS.\\nGenetic disease\\nA genetic disorder or disease is caused by one or more genetic mutations. It is often inherited, but some mutations are random and de novo.\\nHereditary or inherited disease\\nA hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are hereditary (and can run in families)\\nIatrogenic disease\\nAn iatrogenic disease or condition is one that is caused by medical intervention, whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome.\\nIdiopathic disease\\nAn idiopathic disease has an unknown cause or source. As medical science has advanced, many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status. For example, when germs were discovered, it became known that they were a cause of infection, but particular germs and diseases had not been linked. In another example, it is known that autoimmunity is the cause of some forms of diabetes mellitus type 1, even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood. It is also common to know certain factors are associated with certain diseases; however, association does not necessarily imply causality. For example, a third factor might be causing both the disease, and the associated phenomenon.\\nIncurable disease\\nA disease that cannot be cured. Incurable diseases are not necessarily terminal diseases, and sometimes a disease\\'s symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on quality of life.\\nPrimary disease\\nA primary disease is a disease that is due to a root cause of illness, as opposed to secondary disease, which is a sequela, or complication that is caused by the primary disease. For example, a common cold is a primary disease, where rhinitis is a possible secondary disease, or sequela. A doctor must determine what primary disease, a cold or bacterial infection, is causing a patient\\'s secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics.\\nSecondary disease\\nA secondary disease is a disease that is a sequela or complication of a prior, causal disease, which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause (root cause). For example, a bacterial infection can be primary, wherein a healthy person is exposed to bacteria and becomes infected, or it can be secondary to a primary cause, that predisposes the body to infection. For example, a primary viral infection that weakens the immune system could lead to a secondary bacterial infection. Similarly, a primary burn that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria, and lead to a secondary bacterial infection.\\nTerminal disease\\nA terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death. Previously, AIDS was a terminal disease; it is now incurable, but can be managed indefinitely using medications.\\nIllness\\nThe terms illness and sickness are both generally used as synonyms for disease; however, the term illness is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient\\'s personal experience of their disease.[6][7][8][9] In this model, it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill (to have an objectively definable, but asymptomatic, medical condition, such as a subclinical infection, or to have a clinically apparent physical impairment but not feel sick or distressed by it), and to be ill without being diseased (such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition, or medicalizes a non-disease situation in their life – for example, a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment, and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions). Symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection, but a collection of evolved responses – sickness behavior by the body – that helps clear infection and promote recovery. Such aspects of illness can include lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and inability to concentrate.[10][11][12]\\nDisorder\\nA disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance that may or may not show specific signs and symptoms. Medical disorders can be categorized into mental disorders, physical disorders, genetic disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, and functional disorders.[13] The term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness, and therefore is preferred terminology in some circumstances.[14] In mental health, the term mental disorder is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of biological, social, and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions; however, the term disorder is also used in many other areas of medicine, primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms, such as metabolic disorders.\\nMedical condition or health condition\\nA medical condition or health condition is a broad concept that includes all diseases, lesions, disorders, or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment, such as pregnancy or childbirth. While the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders, uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for mental disorders.[15] This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some health insurance policies also define a medical condition as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.[16]\\nAs it is more value-neutral than terms like disease, the term medical condition is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. However, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the autism rights movement.\\nThe term medical condition is also a synonym for medical state, in which case it describes an individual patient\\'s current state from a medical standpoint. This usage appears in statements that describe a patient as being in critical condition, for example.\\nMorbidity\\nMorbidity (from Latin  morbidus\\xa0\\'sick, unhealthy\\') is a diseased state, disability, or poor health due to any cause.[17] The term may refer to the existence of any form of disease, or to the degree that the health condition affects the patient. Among severely ill patients, the level of morbidity is often measured by ICU scoring systems. Comorbidity, or co-existing disease, is the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, such as schizophrenia and substance abuse.\\nIn epidemiology and actuarial science, the term morbidity (also morbidity rate or morbidity frequency) can refer to either the incidence rate, the prevalence of a disease or medical condition, or the percentage of people who experience a given condition within a given timeframe (e.g., 20% of people will get influenza in a year).[18] This measure of sickness is contrasted with the mortality rate of a condition, which is the proportion of people dying during a given time interval. Morbidity rates are used in actuarial professions, such as health insurance, life insurance, and long-term care insurance, to determine the premiums charged to customers. Morbidity rates help insurers predict the likelihood that an insured will contract or develop any number of specified diseases.\\nPathosis or pathology\\nPathosis (plural pathoses) is synonymous with disease. The word pathology also has this sense, in which it is commonly used by physicians in the medical literature, although some editors prefer to reserve pathology to its other senses. Sometimes a slight connotative shade causes preference for pathology or pathosis implying \"some [as yet poorly analyzed] pathophysiologic process\" rather than disease implying \"a specific disease entity as defined by diagnostic criteria being already met\". This is hard to quantify denotatively, but it explains why cognitive synonymy is not invariable.\\nSyndrome\\nA syndrome is the association of several signs and symptoms, or other characteristics that often occur together, regardless of whether the cause is known. Some syndromes such as Down syndrome are known to have only one cause (an extra chromosome at birth). Others such as Parkinsonian syndrome are known to have multiple possible causes. Acute coronary syndrome, for example, is not a single disease itself but is rather the manifestation of any of several diseases including myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery disease. In yet other syndromes, however, the cause is unknown. A familiar syndrome name often remains in use even after an underlying cause has been found or when there are a number of different possible primary causes. Examples of the first-mentioned type are that Turner syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome are still often called by the \"syndrome\" name despite that they can also be viewed as disease entities and not solely as sets of signs and symptoms.\\nPredisease\\nPredisease is a subclinical or prodromal vanguard of a disease. Prediabetes and prehypertension are common examples. The nosology or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a bright line differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical or premonitory status and the conflict of interest–driven over-medicalization (e.g., by pharmaceutical manufacturers) or de-medicalization (e.g., by medical and disability insurers). Identifying legitimate predisease can result in useful preventive measures, such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise,[19] but labeling a healthy person with an unfounded notion of predisease can result in overtreatment, such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or paying for treatments with a poor benefit–cost ratio.\\nOne review proposed three criteria for predisease:\\na high risk for progression to disease making one \"far more likely to develop\" it than others are- for example, a pre-cancer will almost certainly turn into cancer over time\\nactionability for risk reduction – for example, removal of the precancerous tissue prevents it from turning into a potentially deadly cancer\\nbenefit that outweighs the harm of any interventions taken – removing the precancerous tissue prevents cancer, and thus prevents a potential death from cancer.[20]\\nTypes by body system[edit]\\nMental\\nMental illness is a broad, generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or emotional instability, behavioral dysregulation, cognitive dysfunction or impairment. Specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include major depression, generalized anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, to name a few. Mental illness can be of biological (e.g., anatomical, chemical, or genetic) or psychological (e.g., trauma or conflict) origin. It can impair the affected person\\'s ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationship.[citation needed]\\nOrganic\\nAn organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body. The term sometimes excludes infections. It is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders. It includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body (such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury — organic brain disease is a dated term for such cases) but not if they are due to psychosocial issues.\\nStages[edit]\\nIn an infectious disease, the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms. The latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person, which may precede, follow, or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms. Some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase, called viral latency, in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state. For example, varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase; after recovery from chickenpox, the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years, and later cause herpes zoster (shingles).\\n\\nAcute disease\\nAn acute disease is a short-lived disease, like the common cold.\\nChronic disease\\nA chronic disease is one that lasts for a long time, usually at least six months. During that time, it may be constantly present, or it may go into remission and periodically relapse. A chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive (gets worse over time). Some chronic diseases can be permanently cured. Most chronic diseases can be beneficially treated, even if they cannot be permanently cured.\\nClinical disease\\nOne that has clinical consequences; in other words, the stage of the disease that produces the characteristic signs and symptoms of that disease.[21] AIDS is the clinical disease stage of HIV infection.\\nCure\\nA cure is the end of a medical condition or a treatment that is very likely to end it, while remission refers to the disappearance, possibly temporarily, of symptoms. Complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases.\\nFlare-up\\n\"Flareup\" redirects here. For the Transformers character, see Flareup (Transformers).\\nSee also: ExacerbationA flare-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms.[22]\\nProgressive disease\\nProgressive disease is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease until death, serious debility, or organ failure occurs. Slowly progressive diseases are also chronic diseases; many are also degenerative diseases. The opposite of progressive disease is stable disease or static disease: a medical condition that exists, but does not get better or worse.\\nRefractory disease\\nA refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment, especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for the specific disease in question.\\nSubclinical disease\\nAlso called silent disease, silent stage, or asymptomatic disease. This is a stage in some diseases before the symptoms are first noted.[23]\\nTerminal phase\\nIf a person will die soon from a disease, regardless of whether that disease typically causes death, then the stage between the earlier disease process and active dying is the terminal phase.\\nRecovery\\nSee also: Convalescence and RecuperationRecovery can refer to the repairing of physical processes (tissues, organs etc.) and the resumption of healthy functioning after damage causing processes have been cured.\\nExtent[edit]\\nThis rash only affects one part of the body, so it is a localized disease.\\nLocalized disease\\nA localized disease is one that affects only one part of the body, such as athlete\\'s foot or an eye infection.\\nDisseminated disease\\nA disseminated disease has spread to other parts; with cancer, this is usually called metastatic disease.\\nSystemic disease\\nA systemic disease is a disease that affects the entire body, such as influenza or high blood pressure.\\nClassification[edit]\\nMain articles: Nosology and Medical classification\\nDiseases may be classified by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism by which the disease is caused), or by symptoms. Alternatively, diseases may be classified according to the organ system involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.\\nA chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown. Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms (syndrome).\\nClassical classification of human disease derives from the observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Today it is preferred to classify them by their cause if it is known.[24]\\nThe most known and used classification of diseases is the World Health Organization\\'s ICD. This is periodically updated. Currently, the last publication is the ICD-11.\\n\\nCauses[edit]\\nSee also: Cause (medicine) and Transmission (medicine)\\nDiseases can be caused by any number of factors and may be acquired or congenital. Microorganisms, genetics, the environment or a combination of these can contribute to a diseased state.[25]\\nOnly some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious. The microorganisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be transmitted, e.g. by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces, by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease, and from contaminated water or food (often via fecal contamination), etc.[26] Also, there are sexually transmitted diseases. In some cases, microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role, while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes.\\nSome diseases, such as most (but not all) forms of cancer, heart disease, and mental disorders, are non-infectious diseases. Many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis (see genetic disorder) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another.\\nSocial determinants of health are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health. Illnesses are generally related to social, economic, political, and environmental circumstances.[27] Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being. The World Health Organization\\'s Social Determinants Council also recognizes Social determinants of health in poverty.\\nWhen the cause of a disease is poorly understood, societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a metaphor or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil. For example, until the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was discovered in 1882, experts variously ascribed the disease to heredity, a sedentary lifestyle, depressed mood, and overindulgence in sex, rich food, or alcohol, all of which were social ills at the time.[28]\\nWhen a disease is caused by a pathogenic organism (e.g., when malaria is caused by Plasmodium), one should not confuse the pathogen (the cause of the disease) with disease itself. For example, West Nile virus (the pathogen) causes West Nile fever (the disease). The misuse of basic definitions in epidemiology is frequent in scientific publications.[29]\\n\\nTypes of causes[edit]\\nRegular physical activity, such as riding a bicycle or walking, reduces the risk of lifestyle diseases.\\nAirborne\\nAn airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air.[30]\\nFoodborne\\nFoodborne illness or food poisoning is any illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, prions or parasites.[31]\\nInfectious\\nInfectious diseases, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, comprise clinically evident illness (i.e., characteristic medical signs or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection, presence and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism.[32] Included in this category are contagious diseases – an infection, such as influenza or the common cold, that commonly spreads from one person to another – and communicable diseases – a disease that can spread from one person to another, but does not necessarily spread through everyday contact.\\nLifestyle\\nA lifestyle disease is any disease that appears to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer, especially if the risk factors include behavioral choices like a sedentary lifestyle or a diet high in unhealthful foods such as refined carbohydrates, trans fats, or alcoholic beverages.[33]\\nNon-communicable\\nA non-communicable disease is a medical condition or disease that is non-transmissible.[34] Non-communicable diseases cannot be spread directly from one person to another. Heart disease and cancer are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans.[35]\\nPrevention[edit]\\nMain article: Preventive medicine\\nMany diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means. These include sanitation, proper nutrition, adequate exercise, vaccinations and other self-care and public health measures, such as obligatory face mask mandates[citation needed].\\n\\nTreatments[edit]\\nMain article: Therapy\\nMedical therapies or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problems. In the medical field, therapy is synonymous with the word treatment. Among psychologists, the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy or \"talk therapy\". Common treatments include medications, surgery, medical devices, and self-care. Treatments may be provided by an organized health care system, or informally, by the patient or family members.\\nPreventive healthcare is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, or disease in the first place. A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started. A treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem, but treatments may not produce permanent cures, especially in chronic diseases. Cures are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently. Many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable. Pain management (also called pain medicine) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain.[36]\\nTreatment for medical emergencies must be provided promptly, often through an emergency department or, in less critical situations, through an urgent care facility.\\n\\nEpidemiology[edit]\\nMain article: Epidemiology\\nEpidemiology is the study of the factors that cause or encourage diseases. Some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas, among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics, or at different times of the year.\\nEpidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for diseases. In the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the work of epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation to study design, data collection, and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a syndemic. Epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as biology (to better understand disease processes), biostatistics (the current raw information available), Geographic Information Science (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors). Epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts.\\nIn studying diseases, epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them. Especially for poorly understood diseases, different groups might use significantly different definitions. Without an agreed-on definition, different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease.[37]\\nSome morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities, at national levels[38][39] or larger scale (such as European Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB))[40] which may contain hospital discharge data by detailed diagnosis, age and sex. The European HMDB data was submitted by European countries to the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe.\\n\\nBurdens of disease[edit]\\nDisease burden is the impact of a health problem in an area measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators.\\nThere are several measures used to quantify the burden imposed by diseases on people. The years of potential life lost (YPLL) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person\\'s life was shortened due to a disease. For example, if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease, and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease, then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of potential life. YPLL measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying, so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent. In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 932 million years of potential life were lost to premature death.[41]\\nThe quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metrics are similar but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis. In addition to the number of years lost due to premature death, these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick. Unlike YPLL, these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick, but who live a normal lifespan. A disease that has high morbidity, but low mortality, has a high DALY and a low YPLL. In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 1.5\\xa0billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury.[41] In the developed world, heart disease and stroke cause the most loss of life, but neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause the most years lost to being sick.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisease category\\n\\nPercent of all YPLLs lost, worldwide[41]\\n\\nPercent of all DALYs lost, worldwide[41]\\n\\nPercent of all YPLLs lost, Europe[41]\\n\\nPercent of all DALYs lost, Europe[41]\\n\\nPercent of all YPLLs lost, US and Canada[41]\\n\\nPercent of all DALYs lost, US and Canada[41]\\n\\n\\nInfectious and parasitic diseases, especially lower respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria\\n\\n37%\\n\\n26%\\n\\n9%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n\\nNeuropsychiatric conditions, e.g. depression\\n\\n2%\\n\\n13%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n19%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n28%\\n\\n\\nInjuries, especially motor vehicle accidents\\n\\n14%\\n\\n12%\\n\\n18%\\n\\n13%\\n\\n18%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n\\nCardiovascular diseases, principally heart attacks and stroke\\n\\n14%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n35%\\n\\n23%\\n\\n26%\\n\\n14%\\n\\n\\nPremature birth and other perinatal deaths\\n\\n11%\\n\\n8%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n\\nCancer\\n\\n8%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n19%\\n\\n11%\\n\\n25%\\n\\n13%\\n\\nSociety and culture[edit]\\nObesity was a status symbol in Renaissance culture: \"The Tuscan General Alessandro del Borro\", attributed to Andrea Sacchi, 1645.[42] It is now generally regarded as a disease.\\nHow a society responds to diseases is the subject of medical sociology.\\nA condition may be considered a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others. For example, obesity was associated with prosperity and abundance, and this perception persists in many African regions, especially since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS.[43] Epilepsy is considered a sign of spiritual gifts among the Hmong people.[44]\\nSickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits, such as illness benefits, work avoidance, and being looked after by others. The person who is sick takes on a social role called the sick role. A person who responds to a dreaded disease, such as cancer, in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher social status.[45] In return for these benefits, the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more. As a comparison, consider pregnancy, which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness, even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care.\\nMost religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick. For example, one whose life would be endangered by fasting on Yom Kippur or during the month of Ramadan is exempted from the requirement, or even forbidden from participating.[46][47] People who are sick are also exempted from social duties. For example, ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an American to refuse an invitation to the White House.[48]\\nThe identification of a condition as a disease, rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function, can have significant social or economic implications. The controversial recognition of diseases such as repetitive stress injury (RSI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations, and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing aging as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.\\nLepers were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease, and the term \"leper\" still evokes social stigma. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.\\nSocial standing and economic status affect health. Diseases of poverty are diseases that are associated with poverty and low social status; diseases of affluence are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status. Which diseases are associated with which states vary according to time, place, and technology. Some diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, may be associated with both poverty (poor food choices) and affluence (long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles), through different mechanisms. The term lifestyle diseases describes diseases associated with longevity and that are more common among older people. For example, cancer is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of 80 than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of 50.\\n\\nLanguage of disease[edit]\\nAn illness narrative is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual\\'s personal experience.\\nPeople use metaphors to make sense of their experiences with disease. The metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an affective experience. The most popular metaphors draw on military concepts: Disease is an enemy that must be feared, fought, battled, and routed. The patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior, rather than a passive victim or bystander. The agents of communicable diseases are invaders; non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war. Because the threat is urgent, perhaps a matter of life and death, unthinkably radical, even oppressive, measures are society\\'s and the patient\\'s moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction. The War on Cancer is an example of this metaphorical use of language.[49] This language is empowering to some patients, but leaves others feeling like they are failures.[50]\\nAnother class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey: The person travels to or from a place of disease, and changes himself, discovers new information, or increases his experience along the way. He may travel \"on the road to recovery\" or make changes to \"get on the right track\" or choose \"pathways\".[49][50] Some are explicitly immigration-themed: the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill, changing identity and relationships in the process.[51] This language is more common among British healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression.[50]\\nSome metaphors are disease-specific. Slavery is a common metaphor for addictions: The alcoholic is enslaved by drink, and the smoker is captive to nicotine. Some cancer patients treat the loss of their hair from chemotherapy as a metonymy or metaphor for all the losses caused by the disease.[49]\\nSome diseases are used as metaphors for social ills: \"Cancer\" is a common description for anything that is endemic and destructive in society, such as poverty, injustice, or racism. AIDS was seen as a divine judgment for moral decadence, and only by purging itself from the \"pollution\" of the \"invader\" could society become healthy again.[49] More recently, when AIDS seemed less threatening, this type of emotive language was applied to avian flu and type 2 diabetes mellitus.[52] Authors in the 19th century commonly used tuberculosis as a symbol and a metaphor for transcendence. People with the disease were portrayed in literature as having risen above daily life to become ephemeral objects of spiritual or artistic achievement. In the 20th century, after its cause was better understood, the same disease became the emblem of poverty, squalor, and other social problems.[51]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nMedicine portalBiology portal\\n\\nCryptogenic disease, a disease whose cause is currently unknown\\nDevelopmental disability, severe, lifelong disabilities attributable to mental or physical impairments\\nEnvironmental disease\\nHost–pathogen interaction\\nLists of diseases\\nMitochondrial disease\\nPhilosophy of medicine\\nPlant pathology\\nRare disease, a disease that affects very few people\\nSociology of health and illness\\nSyndrome\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Disease\" at Dorland\\'s Medical Dictionary\\n\\n^ White T (19 December 2014). \"What is the Difference Between an \"Injury\" and \"Disease\" for Comcare Commonwealth Compensation Claims?\".

When the goal of preventing adverse health outcomes is kept in mind, this review poses the idea that \"predisease\" as a category on which to act makes sense only if the following 3 conditions are met. First, the people designated as having predisease must be far more likely to develop the disease than those not so designated. Second, there must be a feasible intervention that, when targeted to people with predisease, effectively reduces the likelihood of developing the disease. Third, the benefits of intervening on predisease must outweigh the harms in the population.\\n\\n^ \"clinical disease\". Mosby\\'s Medical Dictionary (9th\\xa0ed.). Elsevier. 2009.

Human anatomy and physiology is often a ﬁrst course in many educa-\\ntion programs, and is the basis for so many of the more specialized courses. T eachers\\nof introductory anatomy and physiology thus take on a special challenge: We must\\ndistill and express the complexities of human structure and function in a simple way,\\nwithout losing the essence and meaning of the material. That is the goal of this text-\\nbook: to make this material readily accessible to students with diverse backgrounds\\nand varying levels of educational preparation.\\nNo prior knowledge of biology or chemistry is assumed, and even the most funda-\\nmental terms are deﬁned thoroughly. Essential aspects of anatomy are presented\\nclearly and reinforced with excellent illustrations. Essential aspects of physiology are\\ndiscussed simply, yet with accuracy and precision. Again, the illustrations complement\\nthe text material and foster comprehension on the part of the student. These illustra-\\ntions were prepared especially for students for whom this is a ﬁrst course in anatomy\\nand physiology. As you will see, these are images in which detail is readily apparent.\\nAll important parts have been labeled, but the student is not overwhelmed with\\nunnecessary labels. Illustrations of physiology lead the student step-by-step.\\nWherever appropriate, the legends refer students to the text for further description or\\nexplanation. Each illustration also has a question for the student; the illustration ques-\\ntions in a chapter form an ongoing self-test. (The answers are given in Appendix G.)\\nThe text has three unifying themes: the relationship between physiology and\\nanatomy, the interrelations among the organ systems, and the relationship of each\\norgan system to homeostasis. Although each type of cell, tissue, organ, or organ sys-\\ntem is discussed simply and thoroughly in itself, applicable connections are made to\\nother aspects of the body or to the functioning of the body as a whole. Our goal is to\\nprovide your students with the essentials of anatomy and physiology, and in doing so,\\nto help give them a solid foundation for their future work, and an appreciation for the\\nincredible living organism that is the human body.\\nThe sequence of chapters is a very traditional one. Cross-references are used to\\nremind students of what they have learned from previous chapters. Nevertheless, the\\ntextbook is very ﬂexible, and, following the introductory four chapters, the organ sys-\\ntems may be covered in almost any order, depending on the needs of your course.\\nEach chapter is organized from the simple to the more complex, with the anatomy\\nfollowed by the physiology. The Instructor’s Guide presents modiﬁcations of the topic\\nsequences that may be used, again depending on the needs of your course. Certain\\nmore advanced topics may be omitted from each chapter without losing the meaning\\nor ﬂow of the rest of the material, and these are indicated, for each chapter, in the\\nInstructor’s Guide.\\nClinical applications are set apart from the text in boxed inserts. These are often\\naspects of pathophysiology that are related to the normal anatomy or physiology in the\\ntext discussion. Each box presents one particular topic and is referenced at the appro-\\npriate point in the text. This material is intended to be an integral part of the chapter\\n00Scanlon(p3)-FM  8/17/06  10:40 AM  Page vi'),\n",

Use them. Study\\nthem carefully, and they will be of great help to you as you learn. They are\\nintended to help you develop your own mental picture of the body and its\\nparts and processes. Y ou may not have thought of mental pictures as being\\nimportant, but they are, and each new one you create is a major step in learn-\\ning. Each illustration is referenced in the text, so you will know when to con-\\nsult it. With a little concentration, you will have it in your mind for whenever\\nyou need it. Y ou will see that each illustration also has a question after the leg-\\nend. These questions provide an ongoing quiz; try to answer each one as you\\ncome to it. (Will it matter if you’re wrong? No, but answering the questions\\nwill help you to learn.) The answers are given in Appendix G, just before the\\nglossary.\\nBoxes—Discussions of clinical applications are in separate boxes in the text so\\nthat you may ﬁnd and refer to them easily. Y our instructor may include all or\\nsome of these as required reading. If you are planning a career in the health\\nprofessions, these boxes are an introduction to pathophysiology, and you will\\nﬁnd them interesting and helpful.\\nBold Type—This is used whenever a new term is introduced, or when an old\\nterm is especially important. The terms in bold type are fully deﬁned in the\\nglossary, which includes phonetic pronunciations.\\nTables—This format is used to present material in a very concise form. Some\\ntables are summaries of text material and are very useful for a quick review.\\nOther tables present additional material that complements the text material.\\nGlossary—Not within the chapters but at the end, the glossary is the diction-\\nary of the book. All of the terms in bold type, as well as others, are deﬁned\\nhere. Make use of it, rather than wonder what a word means. The sooner you\\nhave a deﬁnition ﬁrmly in your mind, the sooner it is truly part of your\\nknowledge.\\nT o make the best use of your study time, a Student Workbook is available that will\\nhelp you to focus your attention on the essentials in each chapter. Also included are\\ncomprehensive chapter tests to help you determine which topics you have learned\\nthoroughly and which you may have to review. If your instructor has not made the\\nworkbook a required text, you may wish to ask that it be ordered and made available\\nin your bookstore. Y ou will ﬁnd it very helpful.\\nSOME FINAL WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT\\nY our success in this course depends to a great extent on you. T ry to set aside study\\ntime for yourself every day; a little time each day is usually much more productive\\nthan trying to cram at the last minute.\\nAsk questions of yourself as you are studying. What kinds of questions? The sim-\\nplest ones. If you are studying a part of the body such as an organ, ask yourself: What\\nis its name? Where is it? What is it made of? What does it do? That is: name, loca-\\ntion, structure, and function. These are the essentials. If you are studying a process,\\nask yourself: What is happening here? What is its purpose? That is: What is going on?\\nAnd what good is it? Again, these are the essentials.\\nTo the Student ix\\n00Scanlon(p3)-FM  8/17/06  10:40 AM  Page ix'),\n",

Have you ever thought of your-\\nself in this way? Probably not, and yet, in the strictly\\nphysical sense, that is what each of us is. The body\\nconsists of trillions of atoms in speciﬁc arrangements\\nand thousands of chemical reactions proceeding in\\na very orderly manner. That literally describes\\nus, and yet it is clearly not the whole story. The keys\\nto understanding human consciousness and self-\\nawareness are still beyond our grasp. We do not yet\\nknow what enables us to study ourselves—no other\\nanimals do, as far as we know—but we have accumu-\\nlated a great deal of knowledge about what we are\\nmade of and how it all works. Some of this knowledge\\nmakes up the course you are about to take, a course in\\nbasic human anatomy and physiology.\\nAnatomy is the study of body structure, which\\nincludes size, shape, composition, and perhaps even\\ncoloration. Physiology is the study of how the body\\nfunctions. The physiology of red blood cells, for exam-\\nple, includes what these cells do, how they do it, and\\nhow this is related to the functioning of the rest of the\\nbody. Physiology is directly related to anatomy. For\\nexample, red blood cells contain the mineral iron in\\nmolecules of the protein called hemoglobin; this is an\\naspect of their anatomy. The presence of iron enables\\nred blood cells to carry oxygen, which is their function.\\nAll cells in the body must receive oxygen in order to\\nfunction properly, so the physiology of red blood cells\\nis essential to the physiology of the body as a whole.\\nPathophysiology is the study of disorders of func-\\ntioning, and a knowledge of normal physiology makes\\nsuch disorders easier to understand. For example, you\\nare probably familiar with the anemia called iron-\\ndeﬁciency anemia. With insufficient iron in the diet,\\nthere will not be enough iron in the hemoglobin of\\nred blood cells, and hence less oxygen will be trans-\\nported throughout the body, resulting in the symp-\\ntoms of the iron-deﬁciency disorder. This example\\nshows the relationship between anatomy, physiology,\\nand pathophysiology.\\nThe purpose of this text is to enable you to gain\\nan understanding of anatomy and physiology with\\nthe emphasis on normal structure and function. Many\\nexamples of pathophysiology have been included,\\nhowever, to illustrate the relationship of disease to\\nnormal physiology and to describe some of the proce-\\ndures used in the diagnosis of disease. Many of the\\nexamples are clinical applications that will help you\\nbegin to apply what you have learned and demonstrate\\nthat your knowledge of anatomy and physiology will\\nbecome the basis for your further study in the health\\nprofessions.\\nLEVELS OF ORGANIZATION\\nThe human body is organized into structural and\\nfunctional levels of increasing complexity. Each higher\\nlevel incorporates the structures and functions of the\\nprevious level, as you will see. We will begin with the\\nsimplest level, which is the chemical level, and pro-\\nceed to cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. All of\\nthe levels of organization are depicted in Fig. 1–1.\\nCHEMICALS\\nThe chemicals that make up the body may be divided\\ninto two major categories: inorganic and organic.\\nInorganic chemicals are usually simple molecules\\nmade of one or two elements other than carbon (with\\na few exceptions). Examples of inorganic chemicals are\\nwater (H\\n2O); oxygen (O2); one of the exceptions, car-\\nbon dioxide (CO2); and minerals such as iron (Fe), cal-\\ncium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Organic chemicals are\\noften very complex and always contain the elements\\ncarbon and hydrogen. In this category of organic\\nchemicals are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and\\nnucleic acids. The chemical organization of the body\\nis the subject of Chapter 2.\\nCELLS\\nThe smallest living units of structure and function are\\ncells. There are many different types of human cells,\\nthough they all have certain similarities. Each type of\\ncell is made of chemicals and carries out speciﬁc\\nchemical reactions. Cell structure and function are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 3.\\nTISSUES\\nA tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and\\nfunction. There are four groups of tissues:\\nEpithelial tissues—cover or line body surfaces; some\\nare capable of producing secretions with speciﬁc\\nfunctions. The outer layer of the skin and sweat\\nglands are examples of epithelial tissues. Internal\\nepithelial tissues include the walls of capillaries\\n(squamous epithelium) and the kidney tubules\\n(cuboidal epithelium), as shown in Fig. 1–1.\\n4 Organization and General Plan of the Body\\n01Scanlon(p3)-ch01  8/17/06  10:41 AM  Page 4'),\n",

The brain and optic nerves are examples of\\nnerve tissue.\\nThe types of tissues in these four groups, as well as\\ntheir speciﬁc functions, are the subject of Chapter 4.\\nORGANS\\nAn organ is a group of tissues precisely arranged so as\\nto accomplish speciﬁc functions. Examples of organs\\nare the kidneys, individual bones, the liver, lungs,\\nand stomach. The kidneys contain several kinds of\\nepithelial, or surface tissues, for their work of absorp-\\ntion. The stomach is lined with epithelial tissue that\\nsecretes gastric juice for digestion. Smooth muscle\\ntissue in the wall of the stomach contracts to mix\\nfood with gastric juice and propel it to the small intes-\\ntine. Nerve tissue carries impulses that increase or\\ndecrease the contractions of the stomach (see Box 1–1:\\nReplacing Tissues and Organs).\\nORGAN SYSTEMS\\nAn organ system is a group of organs that all con-\\ntribute to a particular function. Examples are the uri-\\nnary system, digestive system, and respiratory system.\\nIn Fig. 1–1 you see the urinary system, which consists\\nof the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.\\nThese organs all contribute to the formation and\\nelimination of urine.\\nAs a starting point, T able 1–1 lists the organ sys-\\ntems of the human body with their general functions,\\nand some representative organs, and Fig. 1–2 depicts\\n6 Organization and General Plan of the Body\\nBOX 1–1 REPLACING TISSUES AND ORGANS\\neventually be used to cover a large surface. Other\\ncells grown in culture include cartilage, bone, pan-\\ncreas, and liver. Much research is being done on\\nliver implants (not transplants), clusters of func-\\ntional liver cells grown in a lab. Such implants\\nwould reduce or eliminate the need for human\\ndonors. Tissue engineering is also being used to cre-\\nate arteries and urinary bladders.\\nMany artiﬁcial replacement parts have also been\\ndeveloped. These are made of plastic or metal and\\nare not rejected as foreign by the recipient’s\\nimmune system. Damaged heart valves, for exam-\\nple, may be replaced by artiﬁcial ones, and sections\\nof arteries may be replaced by tubular grafts made\\nof synthetic materials. Artiﬁcial joints are available\\nfor every joint in the body, as is artiﬁcial bone for\\nreconstructive surgery. Cochlear implants are tiny\\ninstruments that convert sound waves to electrical\\nimpulses the brain can learn to interpret, and have\\nprovided some sense of hearing for people with cer-\\ntain types of deafness. Work is also progressing on\\nthe use of a featherweight computer chip as an arti-\\nﬁcial retina, on devices that help damaged hearts\\npump blood more efficiently, and on small, self-\\ncontained artiﬁcial hearts.\\nBlood transfusions are probably the most familiar\\nand frequent form of “replacement parts” for peo-\\nple. Blood is a tissue, and when properly typed and\\ncross-matched (blood types will be discussed in\\nChapter 11) may safely be given to someone with\\nthe same or a compatible blood type.\\nOrgans, however, are much more complex struc-\\ntures. When a patient receives an organ transplant,\\nthere is always the possibility of rejection (destruc-\\ntion) of the organ by the recipient’s immune sys-\\ntem (Chapter 14). With the discovery and use of\\nmore effective immune-suppressing medications,\\nhowever, the success rate for many types of organ\\ntransplants has increased. Organs that may be trans-\\nplanted include corneas, kidneys, the heart, the\\nliver, and the lungs.\\nThe skin is also an organ, but skin transplanted\\nfrom another person will not survive very long.\\nSeveral kinds of artiﬁcial skin are now available to\\ntemporarily cover large areas of damaged skin.\\nPatients with severe burns, for example, will even-\\ntually need skin grafts from their own unburned\\nskin to form permanent new skin over the burn\\nsites.

Homeostasis reﬂects the abil-\\nity of the body to maintain a relatively stable metabo-\\nlism and to function normally despite many constant\\nchanges. The changes that are part of normal metab-\\nolism may be internal or external, and the body must\\nrespond appropriately.\\nEating breakfast, for example, brings about an\\ninternal change. Suddenly there is food in the stom-\\nach, and something must be done with it. What hap-\\npens? The food is digested or broken down into\\nsimple chemicals that the body can use. The protein in\\na hard-boiled egg is digested into amino acids, its basic\\nchemical building blocks; these amino acids can then\\nbe used by the cells of the body to produce their own\\nspecialized proteins.\\nAn example of an external change is a rise in envi-\\nronmental temperature. On a hot day, the body tem-\\nperature would also tend to rise. However, body\\ntemperature must be kept within its normal range of\\nabout 97 /H11034to 99 /H11034F (36 /H11034to 38 /H11034C) in order to support\\nnormal functioning. What happens? One of the body’s\\nresponses to the external temperature rise is to\\nincrease sweating so that excess body heat can be lost\\nby the evaporation of sweat on the surface of the skin.\\nThis response, however, may bring about an undesir-\\nable internal change, dehydration. What happens? As\\nbody water decreases, we feel the sensation of thirst\\nand drink ﬂuids to replace the water lost in sweating.\\nNotice that when certain body responses occur, they\\nreverse the event that triggered them. In the preced-\\ning example a rising body temperature stimulates\\nincreased sweating, which lowers body temperature,\\nwhich in turn decreases sweating. Unnecessary sweat-\\ning that would be wasteful of water is prevented. This\\nis an example of a negative feedback mechanism, in\\nwhich the body’s response reverses the stimulus (in\\neffect, turning it off for a while) and keeps some aspect\\nof the body metabolism within its normal range.\\nLook at Fig. 1–3 for another negative feedback\\nmechanism, one in which the hormone thyroxine reg-\\nulates the metabolic rate of the body. As metabolic\\nrate decreases, the hypothalamus (part of the brain)\\nand pituitary gland detect this decrease and secrete\\nhormones to stimulate the thyroid gland (on the front\\nof the neck just below the larynx) to secrete the hor-\\nmone thyroxine. Thyroxine stimulates the cellular\\nenzyme systems that produce energy from food, which\\nincreases the metabolic rate. The rise in energy and\\nheat production is detected by the brain and pituitary\\ngland. They then decrease secretion of their hor-\\nmones, which in turn inhibits any further secretion of\\nthyroxine until the metabolic rate decreases again.\\nMetabolic rate does rise and fall, but is kept within\\nnormal limits.\\nY ou may be wondering if there is such a thing as a\\npositive feedback mechanism. There is, but they are\\nrare in the body and quite different from a negative\\nfeedback mechanism. In a positive feedback mecha-\\nnism, the response to the stimulus does not stop or\\nreverse the stimulus, but instead keeps the sequence of\\nevents going. A good example is childbirth, in which\\nthe sequence of events, simply stated, is as follows:\\nStretching of the uterine cervix stimulates secretion of\\nthe hormone oxytocin by the posterior pituitary gland.\\nOxytocin stimulates contraction of the uterine muscle,\\nwhich causes more stretching, which stimulates more\\noxytocin and, hence, more contractions. The mecha-\\nnism stops with the delivery of the baby and the pla-\\ncenta. This is the “brake,” the interrupting event.\\nAny positive feedback mechanism requires an\\nexternal “brake,” something to interrupt it. Blood\\nclotting is such a mechanism, and without external\\ncontrols, clotting may become a vicious cycle of clot-\\nting and more clotting, doing far more harm than\\ngood (discussed in Chapter 11). Inﬂammation follow-\\ning an injury is beneﬁcial and necessary for repair to\\nbegin, but the process may evolve into a cycle of dam-\\nage and more damage. The rise of a fever may also\\ntrigger a positive feedback mechanism. Notice in Fig.\\n1–3 that bacteria have affected the body’s thermostat\\nin the hypothalamus and caused a fever. The rising\\nbody temperature increases the metabolic rate, which\\nincreases body temperature even more, becoming a\\ncycle. Where is the inhibition, the brake? For this\\ninfection, the brake is white blood cells destroying the\\nbacteria that caused the fever. An interruption from\\noutside the cycle is necessary. It is for this reason,\\nbecause positive feedback mechanisms have the poten-\\ntial to be self-perpetuating and cause harm, that they\\nare rare in the body.\\nNegative feedback mechanisms, however, contain\\ntheir own brakes in that inhibition is a natural part of\\nthe cycle, and the body has many of them. The secre-\\ntion of most hormones (Chapter 10) is regulated by\\nnegative feedback mechanisms. The regulation of\\nheart rate (Chapter 12) and blood pressure (Chapter\\n13) involves several negative feedback mechanisms.\\n10 Organization and General Plan of the Body\\n01Scanlon(p3)-ch01  8/17/06  10:41 AM  Page 10'),\n",

Today, how-\\never, several technologies and the extensive use of\\ncomputers permit us to see the interior of the body\\nwithout surgery.\\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning uses a\\nnarrowly focused x-ray beam that circles rapidly\\naround the body. A detector then measures how\\nmuch radiation passes through different tissues,\\nand a computer constructs an image of a thin\\nslice through the body. Several images may be\\nmade at different levels—each takes only a few\\nseconds—to provide a more complete picture of\\nan organ or part of the body. The images are\\nmuch more detailed than are those produced by\\nconventional x-rays.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another\\ndiagnostic tool that is especially useful for visual-\\nizing soft tissues, including the brain and spinal\\ncord. Recent reﬁnements have produced images\\nof individual nerve bundles, which had not been\\npossible using any other technique. The patient\\nis placed inside a strong magnetic ﬁeld, and the\\ntissues are pulsed with radio waves. Because\\neach tissue has different proportions of various\\natoms, which resonate or respond differently,\\neach tissue emits a characteristic signal. A com-\\nputer then translates these signals into an image;\\nthe entire procedure takes 30 to 45 minutes.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scanning\\ncreates images that depict the rates of physio-\\nlogical processes such as blood ﬂow, oxygen\\nusage, or glucose metabolism. The comparative\\nrates are depicted by colors: Red represents the\\nhighest rate, followed by yellow, then green, and\\nﬁnally blue representing the lowest rate.\\nOne drawback of these technologies is their cost;\\nthey are expensive. However, the beneﬁts to\\npatients are great: Highly detailed images of the\\nbody are obtained without the risks of surgery and\\nwith virtually no discomfort in the procedures them-\\nselves.\\n01Scanlon(p3)-ch01  8/17/06  10:41 AM  Page 18'),\n",

The air we breathe is a mixture of chem-\\nicals in the form of gases. Water, gasoline, and diet\\nsoda are chemicals in liquid form. Our foods are\\nchemicals, and our bodies are complex arrangements\\nof thousands of chemicals. Recall from Chapter 1 that\\nthe simplest level of organization of the body is the\\nchemical level.\\nThis chapter covers some very basic aspects of\\nchemistry as they are related to living organisms, and\\nmost especially as they are related to our understand-\\ning of the human body.

An element is a sub-\\nstance made of only one type of atom (therefore, an\\natom is the smallest part of an element). There are 92\\nnaturally occurring elements in the world around us.\\nExamples are hydrogen (H), iron (Fe), oxygen (O),\\ncalcium (Ca), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C). In nature,\\nan element does not usually exist by itself but rather\\ncombines with the atoms of other elements to form\\ncompounds. Examples of some compounds important\\nto our study of the human body are water (H\\n2O), in\\nwhich two atoms of hydrogen combine with one atom\\nof oxygen; carbon dioxide (CO\\n2), in which an atom of\\ncarbon combines with two atoms of oxygen; and glu-\\ncose (C\\n6H12O6), in which six carbon atoms and six\\noxygen atoms combine with 12 hydrogen atoms.\\nThe elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\\nphosphorus, and sulfur are found in all living things. If\\ncalcium is included, these seven elements make up\\napproximately 99% of the human body (weight).\\nMore than 20 different elements are found, in vary-\\ning amounts, in the human body. Some of these are\\nlisted in T able 2–1. As you can see, each element has a\\nstandard chemical symbol. This is simply the ﬁrst (and\\nsometimes the second) letter of the element’s English\\nor Latin name.

An atom consists of\\nthree major subunits or particles: protons, neutrons,\\nand electrons (Fig. 2–1).

The electrons, however, are important in that\\nthey may enable an atom to connect, or bond, to other\\natoms to form molecules. A molecule is a combina-\\ntion of atoms (usually of more than one element) that\\nare so tightly bound together that the molecule\\nbehaves as a single unit.\\nEach atom is capable of bonding in only very spe-\\nciﬁc ways. This capability depends on the number and\\nthe arrangement of the electrons of the atom.\\nElectrons orbit the nucleus of an atom in shells or\\nenergy levels . The ﬁrst, or innermost, energy level\\ncan contain a maximum of two electrons and is then\\nconsidered stable. The second energy level is stable\\nwhen it contains its maximum of eight electrons. The\\nremaining energy levels, more distant from the\\nnucleus, are also most stable when they contain eight\\nelectrons, or a multiple of eight.\\nA few atoms (elements) are naturally stable, or\\nuninterested in reacting, because their outermost\\nenergy level already contains the maximum number of\\nelectrons. The gases helium and neon are examples of\\nthese stable atoms, which do not usually react with\\nother atoms. Most atoms are not stable, however, and\\ntend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to ﬁll\\ntheir outermost shell. By doing so, an atom is capable\\nof forming one or more chemical bonds with other\\natoms. In this way, the atom becomes stable, because\\nits outermost shell of electrons has been ﬁlled. It is\\nthese reactive atoms that are of interest in our study of\\nanatomy and physiology.\\nCHEMICAL BONDS\\nA chemical bond is not a structure, but rather a force\\nor attraction between positive and negative electrical\\ncharges that keeps two or more atoms closely associ-\\nated with each other to form a molecule. By way of\\ncomparison, think of gravity. We know that gravity is\\nnot a “thing,” but rather the force that keeps our feet\\non the ﬂoor and allows us to pour coffee with consis-\\ntent success. Molecules formed by chemical bonding\\noften have physical characteristics different from those\\nof the atoms of the original elements. For example,\\nthe elements hydrogen and oxygen are gases, but\\natoms of each may chemically bond to form molecules\\nof water, which is a liquid.\\nThe type of chemical bonding depends upon the\\ntendencies of the electrons of atoms involved, as you\\nwill see. Four kinds of bonds are very important to the\\nchemistry of the body: ionic bonds, covalent bonds,\\ndisulﬁde bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\\nIONIC BONDS\\nAn ionic bond involves the loss of one or more elec-\\ntrons by one atom and the gain of the electron(s) by\\nanother atom or atoms. Refer to Fig. 2–2 as you read\\nthe following.\\nAn atom of sodium (Na) has one electron in its out-\\nermost shell, and in order to become stable, it tends to\\nlose that electron. When it does so, the sodium atom\\nhas one more proton than it has electrons. Therefore,\\nit now has an electrical charge (or valence) of /H110011 and\\nis called a sodium ion (Na\\n/H11001). An atom of chlorine has\\nseven electrons in its outermost shell, and in order to\\nbecome stable tends to gain one electron. When it\\ndoes so, the chlorine atom has one more electron than\\nit has protons, and now has a charge (valence) of /H110021.\\nIt is called a chloride ion (Cl\\n/H11002).\\nWhen an atom of sodium loses an electron to an\\natom of chlorine, their ions have unlike charges (pos-\\nitive and negative) and are thus attracted to one\\nanother. The result is the formation of a molecule of\\nsodium chloride: NaCl, or common table salt. The\\nbond that holds these ions together is called an ionic\\nbond.\\nSome Basic Chemistry 25\\nSecond energy level\\nFirst energy level\\nProton [+]\\nNeutron Nucleus\\nElectrons [--]\\nFigure 2–1.

An atom of calcium has two electrons in its out-\\nermost shell and tends to lose those electrons in order\\nto become stable. If two atoms of chlorine each gain\\none of those electrons, they become chloride ions.\\nThe positive and negative ions are then attracted to\\none another, forming a molecule of calcium chloride,\\nCaCl\\n2, which is also a salt. A salt is a molecule made\\nof ions other than hydrogen (H /H11001) ions or hydroxyl\\n(OH/H11002) ions.\\nIons with positive charges are called cations. These\\ninclude Na /H11001, Ca /H110012, K /H11001, Fe /H110012, and Mg /H110012. Ions with\\nnegative charges are called anions, which include Cl/H11002,\\nSO4\\n/H110022 (sulfate), and HCO3\\n/H11002(bicarbonate). The types\\nof compounds formed by ionic bonding are salts,\\nacids, and bases. (Acids and bases are discussed later in\\nthis chapter.)\\nIn the solid state, ionic bonds are relatively strong.\\nOur bones, for example, contain the salt calcium car-\\nbonate (CaCO\\n3), which helps give bone its strength.\\nHowever, in an aqueous (water) solution, many ionic\\nbonds are weakened. The bonds may become so weak\\nthat the bound ions of a molecule separate, creating a\\nsolution of free positive and negative ions. For exam-\\nple, if sodium chloride is put in water, it dissolves, then\\nionizes. The water now contains Na\\n/H11001ions and Cl /H11002\\nions. Ionization, also called dissociation, is important\\nto living organisms because once dissociated, the ions\\nare free to take part in other chemical reactions within\\nthe body. Cells in the stomach lining produce\\nhydrochloric acid (HCl) and must have Cl\\n/H11002ions to do\\nso. The chloride in NaCl would not be free to take\\npart in another reaction since it is tightly bound to the\\nsodium atom. However, the Cl /H11002ions available from\\nionized NaCl in the cellular water can be used for the\\nsynthesis, or chemical manufacture, of HCl in the\\nstomach.\\nCOVALENT BONDS\\nCovalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons\\nbetween atoms. As shown in Fig. 2–3, an atom of oxy-\\ngen needs two electrons to become stable. It may\\nshare two of its electrons with another atom of oxy-\\ngen, also sharing two electrons. T ogether they form a\\nmolecule of oxygen gas (O\\n2), which is the form in\\nwhich oxygen exists in the atmosphere.\\nAn atom of oxygen may also share two of its elec-\\ntrons with two atoms of hydrogen, each sharing its\\nsingle electron (see Fig. 2–3).

The production of the protein hemoglobin in\\npotential red blood cells is an example of a synthesis\\nreaction. Proteins are synthesized by the bonding of\\nmany amino acids, their smaller subunits. Synthesis\\nreactions require energy for the formation of bonds.\\nIn a decomposition reaction , bonds are broken,\\nand a large molecule is changed to two or more\\nsmaller ones. One example is the digestion of large\\nmolecules of starch into many smaller glucose mole-\\ncules. Some decomposition reactions release energy;\\nthis is described in a later section on cell respiration.\\nIn this and future chapters, keep in mind that the\\nterm reaction refers to the making or breaking of\\nchemical bonds and thus to changes in the physical\\nand chemical characteristics of the molecules\\ninvolved.\\nINORGANIC COMPOUNDS\\nOF IMPORTANCE\\nInorganic compounds are usually simple molecules\\nthat often consist of only one or two different ele-\\nments. Despite their simplicity, however, some inor-\\nganic compounds are essential to normal structure and\\nfunctioning of the body.\\nWATER\\nWater makes up 60% to 75% of the human body, and\\nis essential to life for several reasons:\\n1. Water is a solvent; that is, many substances (called\\nsolutes) can dissolve in water. Nutrients such as\\nglucose are dissolved in blood plasma (which is\\nlargely water) to be transported to cells throughout\\nthe body. The sense of taste depends upon the sol-\\nvent ability of saliva; dissolved food stimulates the\\nreceptors in taste buds.

Water changes temperature slowly . Water has a high\\nheat capacity, which means that it will absorb a\\ngreat deal of heat before its temperature rises sig-\\nniﬁcantly, or it must lose a great deal of heat before\\nits temperature drops signiﬁcantly.

This gives each hexose sugar a different three-\\ndimensional shape. The liver is able to change fructose\\nand galactose to glucose, which is then used by cells in\\nthe process of cell respiration to produce ATP .\\nAnother type of monosaccharide is the pentose, or\\nﬁve-carbon, sugar. These are not involved in energy\\nproduction but rather are structural components of\\nthe nucleic acids. Deoxyribose (C\\n5H10O4) is part of\\nDNA, which is the genetic material of chromosomes.\\nRibose (C\\n5H10O5) is part of RNA, which is essential\\nfor protein synthesis. We will return to the nucleic\\nacids later in this chapter.\\nDisaccharides are double sugars, made of two\\nmonosaccharides linked by a covalent bond. Sucrose,\\nor cane sugar, for example, is made of one glucose and\\none fructose. Others are lactose (glucose and galac-\\ntose) and maltose (two glucose), which are also present\\nin food. Disaccharides are digested into monosaccha-\\nrides and then used for energy production.\\nThe preﬁx oligo means “few”; oligosaccharides\\nconsist of from 3 to 20 monosaccharides. In human\\ncells, oligosaccharides are found on the outer surface\\nof cell membranes. Here they serve as antigens,\\nwhich are chemical markers (or “signposts”) that iden-\\ntify cells. The A, B, and AB blood types, for example,\\nare the result of oligosaccharide antigens on the outer\\nsurface of red blood cell membranes. All of our cells\\nhave “self” antigens, which identify the cells that\\nbelong in an individual. The presence of “self” anti-\\ngens on our own cells enables the immune system to\\nrecognize antigens that are “non-self.” Such foreign\\nantigens include bacteria and viruses, and immunity\\nwill be a major topic of Chapter 14.\\nPolysaccharides are made of thousands of glucose\\nmolecules, bonded in different ways, resulting in dif-\\nferent shapes (see Fig. 2–6). Starches are branched\\nchains of glucose and are produced by plant cells to\\nstore energy. We have digestive enzymes that split the\\nbonds of starch molecules, releasing glucose. The glu-\\ncose is then absorbed and used by cells to produce\\nATP.\\nGlycogen, a highly branched chain of glucose mol-\\necules, is our own storage form for glucose. After a\\nmeal high in carbohydrates, the blood glucose level\\nrises. Excess glucose is then changed to glycogen and\\nstored in the liver and skeletal muscles. When the\\nblood glucose level decreases between meals, the\\nglycogen is converted back to glucose, which is\\nreleased into the blood (these reactions are regulated\\nby insulin and other hormones). The blood glucose\\nlevel is kept within normal limits, and cells can take in\\nthis glucose to produce energy.\\nCellulose is a nearly straight chain of glucose mol-\\necules produced by plant cells as part of their cell\\nwalls. We have no enzyme to digest the cellulose we\\nconsume as part of vegetables and grains, and it passes\\nthrough the digestive tract unchanged. Another name\\nfor dietary cellulose is “ﬁber,” and although we cannot\\nuse its glucose for energy, it does have a function.\\nFiber provides bulk within the cavity of the large\\nintestine. This promotes efficient peristalsis, the\\nwaves of contraction that propel undigested material\\nthrough the colon. A diet low in ﬁber does not give\\nthe colon much exercise, and the muscle tissue of the\\ncolon will contract weakly, just as our skeletal muscles\\nwill become ﬂabby without exercise. A diet high in\\nﬁber provides exercise for the colon muscle and may\\nhelp prevent chronic constipation.\\nThe structure and functions of the carbohydrates\\nare summarized in T able 2–3.\\nLIPIDS\\nLipids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and\\noxygen; some also contain phosphorus. In this group\\nof organic compounds are different types of sub-\\nstances with very different functions. We will con-\\nsider three types: true fats, phospholipids, and steroids\\n(Fig. 2–7).\\nTrue fats (also called neutral fats) are made of one\\nmolecule of glycerol and one, two, or three fatty acid\\nmolecules. If three fatty acid molecules are bonded to\\na single glycerol, a triglyceride is formed. T wo fatty\\nacids and a glycerol form a diglyceride, and one fatty\\nacid and a glycerol form a monoglyceride.\\nThe fatty acids in a true fat may be saturated or\\nunsaturated. Refer to Fig. 2–7 and notice that one of\\nthe fatty acids has single covalent bonds between all its\\ncarbon atoms. Each of these carbons is then bonded to\\nthe maximum number of hydrogens; this is a saturated\\nfatty acid, meaning saturated with hydrogen. The\\nother fatty acids shown have one or more (poly) dou-\\nble covalent bonds between their carbons and less\\nthan the maximum number of hydrogens; these are\\nunsaturated fatty acids.

Saturated fats tend to be found\\nin animal foods such as beef, pork, eggs, and cheese,\\nbut palm oil and coconut oil are also saturated.\\nUnsaturated fats are found in other plant oils such as\\ncorn oil, sunﬂower oil, and safflower oil, but certain\\nﬁsh oils are also unsaturated, and even pork contains\\nunsaturated fatty acids.\\nUnsaturated fats may be changed to saturated fats\\nin order to give packaged foods a more pleasing tex-\\nture or taste, or to allow them to be stored longer\\nwithout refrigeration (a longer shelf life). These are\\nhydrogenated fats (meaning that hydrogens have been\\nadded), also called trans fats. T rans fats contribute sig-\\nniﬁcantly to atherosclerosis of arteries, that is,\\nabnormal cholesterol deposits in the lining that may\\nclog arteries, especially the coronary arteries of the\\nheart. (See also Box 2–3: Lipids in the Blood.)\\nThe triglyceride forms of true fats are a storage\\nform for excess food, that is, they are stored energy\\n(potential energy). Any type of food consumed in\\nexcess of the body’s caloric needs will be converted to\\nfat and stored in adipose tissue. Most adipose tissue is\\nsubcutaneous, between the skin and muscles.

Some\\namino acids contain sulfur, which permits the forma-\\ntion of disulﬁde bonds. There are about 20 amino\\nacids that make up human proteins. The structure of\\namino acids is shown in Fig. 2–8. Each amino acid has\\na central carbon atom covalently bonded to an atom of\\nhydrogen, an amino group (NH\\n2), and a carboxyl\\ngroup (COOH). At the fourth bond of the central car-\\nbon is the variable portion of the amino acid, repre-\\nsented by R. The R group may be a single hydrogen\\natom, or a CH\\n3 group, or a more complex conﬁgura-\\ntion of carbon and hydrogen. This gives each of the 20\\namino acids a slightly different physical shape. A bond\\nbetween two amino acids is called a peptide bond ,\\nand a short chain of amino acids linked by peptide\\nbonds is a polypeptide.\\nA protein may consist of from 50 to thousands of\\namino acids. The sequence of the amino acids is\\nspeciﬁc and unique for each protein, and is called\\nits primary structure. This unique sequence, and the\\nhydrogen bonds and disulﬁde bonds formed within\\nthe amino acid chain, determines how the protein will\\nbe folded to complete its synthesis. The folding may\\nbe simple, a helix (coil) or pleated sheet, called the sec-\\nondary structure, or a more complex folding may\\noccur to form a globular protein, called the tertiary\\nstructure. Myoglobin, found in muscles, is a globular\\nprotein (Fig. 2–8). When complete, each protein has a\\ncharacteristic three-dimensional shape, which in turn\\ndetermines its function.

Alterna-\\nting phosphate and sugar molecules form the uprights\\nof the ladder, and pairs of nitrogenous bases form the\\nrungs. The size of the bases and the number of hydro-\\ngen bonds each can form the complementary base\\npairing of the nucleic acids. In DNA, adenine is always\\npaired with thymine (with two hydrogen bonds), and\\nguanine is always paired with cytosine (with three\\nhydrogen bonds).\\nDNA makes up the chromosomes of cells and is,\\ntherefore, the genetic code for hereditary characteris-\\ntics. The sequence of bases in the DNA strands is actu-\\nally a code for the many kinds of proteins living things\\nproduce; the code is the same in plants, other animals,\\nand microbes. The sequence of bases for one protein is\\ncalled a gene. Human genes are the codes for the pro-\\nteins produced by human cells (though many of these\\ngenes are also found in all other forms of life—we are\\nall very much related). The functioning of DNA will\\nbe covered in more detail in the next chapter.\\nRNA is often a single strand of nucleotides (see Fig.\\n2–10), with uracil nucleotides in place of thymine\\nnucleotides. RNA is synthesized from DNA in the\\nnucleus of a cell but carries out a major function in the\\ncytoplasm. This function is protein synthesis, which\\nwill also be discussed in the following chapter.\\nATP\\nATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a specialized\\nnucleotide that consists of the base adenine, the sugar\\nribose, and three phosphate groups. Mention has\\nalready been made of ATP as a product of cell respira-\\ntion that contains biologically useful energy. ATP is\\none of several “energy transfer” molecules within\\ncells, transferring the potential energy in food mole-\\ncules to cell processes. When a molecule of glucose is\\nbroken down into carbon dioxide and water with the\\nrelease of energy, the cell uses some of this energy to\\nsynthesize ATP . Present in cells are molecules of ADP\\n(adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate. The energy\\nreleased from glucose is used to loosely bond a third\\nphosphate to ADP , forming ATP . When the bond of\\nthis third phosphate is again broken and energy is\\nreleased, ATP then becomes the energy source for cell\\nprocesses such as mitosis.\\nAll cells have enzymes that can remove the third\\nphosphate group from ATP to release its energy,\\nforming ADP and phosphate. As cell respiration con-\\ntinues, ATP is resynthesized from ADP and phos-\\nphate. ATP formation to trap energy from food and\\nbreakdown to release energy for cell processes is a\\ncontinuing cycle in cells.\\nThe structure and functions of the nucleic acids are\\nsummarized in T able 2–6.\\nSUMMARY\\nAll of the chemicals we have just described are consid-\\nered to be non-living, even though they are essential\\nparts of all living organisms.

This simple statement, called the cell the-\\nory, was ﬁrst proposed more than 150 years ago. Y ou\\nmay think of a theory as a guess or hypothesis, and\\nsometimes this is so. A scientiﬁc theory, however, is\\nactually the best explanation of all available evidence.\\nAll of the evidence science has gathered so far sup-\\nports the validity of the cell theory.\\nCells are the smallest living subunits of a multicel-\\nlular organism such as a human being. A cell is a com-\\nplex arrangement of the chemicals discussed in the\\nprevious chapter, is living, and carries out speciﬁc\\nactivities. Microorganisms, such as amoebas and bac-\\nteria, are single cells that function independently.\\nHuman cells, however, must work together and func-\\ntion interdependently. Homeostasis depends upon the\\ncontributions of all of the different kinds of cells.\\nHuman cells vary in size, shape, and function. Most\\nhuman cells are so small they can only be seen with\\nthe aid of a microscope and are measured in units\\ncalled micrometers (formerly called microns). One\\nmicrometer /H110051/1,000,000 of a meter or 1/25,000 of\\nan inch (see Appendix A: Units of Measure). One\\nexception is the human ovum or egg cell, which is\\nabout 1 millimeter in diameter, just visible to the\\nunaided eye. Some nerve cells, although microscopic\\nin diameter, may be quite long. Those in our arms and\\nlegs, for example, are at least 2 feet (60 cm) long.\\nWith respect to shape, human cells vary greatly.\\nSome are round or spherical, others rectangular, still\\nothers irregular. White blood cells even change shape\\nas they move.\\nCell functions also vary, and since our cells do not\\nact independently, we will cover specialized cell func-\\ntions as part of tissue functions in Chapter 4. Based on\\nfunction, there are more than 200 different kinds of\\nhuman cells. This chapter is concerned with the basic\\nstructure of cells and the cellular activities common to\\nall our cells.\\nCELL STRUCTURE\\nDespite their many differences, human cells have sev-\\neral similar structural features: a cell membrane, a\\nnucleus, and cytoplasm and cell organelles. Red blood\\ncells are an exception because they have no nuclei\\nwhen mature. The cell membrane forms the outer\\nboundary of the cell and surrounds the cytoplasm,\\norganelles, and nucleus.\\nCELL MEMBRANE\\nAlso called the plasma membrane , the cell mem-\\nbrane is made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and pro-\\nteins. The arrangement of these organic molecules is\\nshown in Fig. 3–1. The phospholipids are diglyc-\\nerides, and form a bilayer, or double layer, which\\nmakes up most of the membrane. Phospholipids\\npermit lipid-soluble materials to easily enter or leave\\nthe cell by diffusion through the cell membrane. The\\npresence of cholesterol decreases the ﬂuidity of\\nthe membrane, thus making it more stable. The pro-\\nteins have several functions: Some form channels or\\npores to permit passage of materials such as water or\\nions; others are carrier enzymes or transporters that\\nalso help substances enter the cell. Still other proteins,\\nwith oligosaccharides on their outer surface, are anti-\\ngens, markers that identify the cells of an individual as\\n“self.” Y et another group of proteins serves as recep-\\ntor sites for hormones. Many hormones bring about\\ntheir speciﬁc effects by ﬁrst bonding to a particular\\nreceptor on the cell membrane, a receptor with the\\nproper shape. This bonding, or ﬁt, then triggers\\nchemical reactions within the cell membrane or the\\ninterior of the cell (see Box 10–3 for an illustration\\ninvolving the hormone insulin).\\nMany receptors for other molecules are also part of\\ncell membranes. These molecules are part of the\\nchemical communication networks our cells have. An\\nunavoidable consequence of having so many receptors\\nfor chemical communication is that some pathogens\\nhave evolved shapes to match certain receptors. For\\nexample, HIV , the virus that causes AIDS, just hap-\\npens to ﬁt a particular surface receptor on our white\\nblood cells. When the virus ﬁts in, the receptor\\nbecomes a gateway into the cell, which begins the\\ntakeover of the cell by the virus.\\nMost often, however, the cell membrane is a bene-\\nﬁcial structure. Although the cell membrane is the\\nouter boundary of the cell, it should already be appar-\\nent to you that it is not a static or wall-like boundary,\\nbut rather an active, dynamic one. It is much more like\\na line of tollbooths than a concrete barrier. The cell\\nmembrane is selectively permeable ; that is, certain\\nsubstances are permitted to pass through and others\\n48 Cells\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:42 AM  Page 48'),\n",

These mechanisms of cellular transport will\\nbe covered later in this chapter. The cell membrane is\\nof particular importance for muscle cells and nerve\\ncells because it carries electrical impulses. This will be\\ncovered in Chapters 7 and 8.\\nNUCLEUS\\nWith the exception of mature red blood cells, all\\nhuman cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is within the\\ncytoplasm and is bounded by a double-layered nuclear\\nmembrane with many pores. It contains one or more\\nnucleoli and the chromosomes of the cell (Fig. 3–2).\\nA nucleolus is a small sphere made of DNA, RNA,\\nand protein. The nucleoli form a type of RNA called\\nribosomal RNA, which becomes part of ribosomes\\n(a cell organelle) and is involved in protein synthesis.\\nThe nucleus is the control center of the cell\\nbecause it contains the chromosomes. Even with a\\nmicroscope, the 46 chromosomes of a human cell are\\nusually not visible; they are long threads called chro-\\nmatin. Before a cell divides, however, the chromatin\\ncoils extensively into visible chromosomes. Chromo-\\nsomes are made of DNA and protein. Some chromo-\\nsomal proteins provide the structural framework for\\nthe coiling of the chromatin into chromosomes so\\nthat cell division can take place. Other chromosomal\\nproteins help regulate the activity of the DNA.\\nRemember from our earlier discussion that the DNA\\nis the genetic code for the characteristics and activities\\nof the cell.

They are also shown in Fig. 3–2.\\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive\\nnetwork of membranous tubules that extend from\\nthe nuclear membrane to the cell membrane. Rough\\nER has numerous ribosomes on its surface, whereas\\nsmooth ER has no ribosomes. As a network of inter-\\nconnected tunnels, the ER is a passageway for the\\ntransport of the materials necessary for cell function\\nwithin the cell. These include proteins synthesized by\\nthe ribosomes on the rough ER, and lipids synthesized\\nby the smooth ER.\\nRibosomes are very small structures made of pro-\\ntein and ribosomal RNA. Some are found on the sur-\\nface of rough ER, while others ﬂoat freely within the\\ncytoplasm. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis.\\nThe proteins produced may be structural proteins\\nsuch as collagen in the skin, enzymes, or hormones\\nsuch as insulin that regulate cellular processes. These\\nproteins may function within the cell or be secreted\\nfrom the cell to be used elsewhere in the body.\\nOur protein molecules are subject to damage, and\\nsome cellular proteins, especially regulatory proteins,\\nmay be needed just for a very short time. All such\\nproteins must be destroyed, and this is the function\\nof proteasomes. A proteasome is a barrel-shaped\\norganelle made of enzymes that cut protein molecules\\napart (protease enzymes). Proteins that are to be des-\\ntroyed, that is, those no longer needed or those that\\nare damaged or misfolded, are tagged by a protein\\ncalled ubiquitin (sort of a cellular mop or broom) and\\ncarried into a proteasome. The protein is snipped\\ninto peptides or amino acids, which may be used again\\nfor protein synthesis on ribosomes. Proteasomes are\\nparticularly important during cell division and during\\nembryonic development, when great changes are tak-\\ning place very rapidly as cells become specialized.\\nMany of our cells have secretory functions, that is,\\nthey produce speciﬁc products to be used elsewhere in\\ntissues. Secretion is one task of the Golgi apparatus,\\na series of ﬂat, membranous sacs, somewhat like\\na stack of saucers. Carbohydrates are synthesized\\nwithin the Golgi apparatus, and are packaged, along\\nwith other materials, for secretion from the cell.\\nProteins from the ribosomes or lipids from the\\nsmooth endoplasmic reticulum may also be secreted in\\nthis way. T o secrete a substance, small sacs of the\\nGolgi membrane break off and fuse with the cell\\nmembrane, releasing the substance to the exterior of\\nthe cell. This is exocytosis, exo meaning “to go out”\\nof the cell.\\nMitochondria are oval or spherical organelles\\nbounded by a double membrane. The inner mem-\\nbrane has folds called cristae. Within the mitochon-\\ndria, the aerobic (oxygen-requiring) reactions of cell\\nrespiration take place. Therefore, mitochondria are\\nthe site of ATP (and hence energy) production. Cells\\nthat require large amounts of ATP , such as muscle\\ncells, have many mitochondria to meet their need for\\nenergy. Mitochondria contain their own genes in a\\nsingle DNA molecule and duplicate themselves when\\na cell divides. An individual’s mitochondrial DNA\\n(mDNA) is of maternal origin, that is, from the mito-\\nchondria that were present in the ovum, or egg cell,\\nwhich was then fertilized by a sperm cell. The mito-\\nchondria of the sperm cell usually do not enter the\\novum during fertilization, because they are not found\\nin the head of the sperm with the chromosomes (see\\nFig. 20–1).\\nLysosomes are single-membrane structures that\\ncontain digestive enzymes. When certain white blood\\ncells engulf bacteria, the bacteria are digested and\\ndestroyed by these lysosomal enzymes. Worn-out cell\\nparts and dead cells are also digested by these enzymes.\\nThis is a beneﬁcial process, and is necessary before tis-\\nsue repair can begin. But it does have a disadvantage in\\nthat lysosomal digestion contributes to inﬂammation\\nin damaged tissues. An excess of inﬂammation can\\nstart a vicious cycle, actually a positive feedback mech-\\nanism, that results in extensive tissue damage.\\nMany of our cells are capable of dividing, or repro-\\nducing, themselves. Centrioles are a pair of rod-\\nshaped structures perpendicular to one another,\\nlocated just outside the nucleus. Their function is to\\norganize the spindle ﬁbers during cell division. The\\nspindle ﬁbers are contracting proteins that pull the\\ntwo sets of chromosomes apart, toward the ends of the\\noriginal cell as it divides into two new cells. Each new\\ncell then has a full set of chromosomes.\\nCilia and ﬂagella are mobile thread-like projec-\\ntions through the cell membrane; each is anchored by\\na basal body just within the membrane. Cilia are usu-\\nally shorter than ﬂagella, and an individual cell has\\nmany of them on its free surface. The cilia of a cell\\nbeat in unison and sweep materials across the cell sur-\\nface. Cells lining the fallopian tubes, for example, have\\ncilia to sweep the egg cell toward the uterus. The only\\nhuman cell with a ﬂagellum is the sperm cell. The ﬂa-\\ngellum provides motility, or movement, for the sperm\\ncell.\\nMicrovilli are folds of the cell membrane on the\\nfree surface of a cell.

But others do\\nrequire energy, often in the form of ATP . Each of\\nthese mechanisms is described in the following sec-\\ntions and an example is included to show how each is\\nimportant to the body.\\nDIFFUSION\\nDiffusion is the movement of molecules from an area\\nof greater concentration to an area of lesser concen-\\ntration (that is, with or along a concentration gradi-\\nent). Diffusion occurs because molecules have free\\nenergy; that is, they are always in motion. The mole-\\ncules in a solid move very slowly; those in a liquid\\nmove faster; and those in a gas move faster still, such\\nas when ice absorbs heat energy, melts, and then evap-\\norates. Imagine a green sugar cube at the bottom of a\\nglass of water (green so that we can see it). As the\\nsugar dissolves, the sugar molecules collide with one\\nanother or the water molecules, and the green color\\nseems to rise in the glass. These collisions spread out\\nthe sugar molecules until they are evenly dispersed\\namong the water molecules (this would take a very\\nlong time), and the water eventually becomes entirely\\ngreen. The molecules are still moving, but as some go\\nto the top, others go to the bottom, and so on. Thus,\\nan equilibrium (or steady state) is reached.\\nDiffusion is a very slow process, but may be an\\neffective transport mechanism across microscopic dis-\\ntances. Within the body, the gases oxygen and carbon\\ndioxide move by diffusion. In the lungs, for example,\\nthere is a high concentration of oxygen in the alveoli\\n(air sacs) and a low concentration of oxygen in the\\nblood in the surrounding pulmonary capillaries (see\\nFig. 3–3). The opposite is true for carbon dioxide: a\\nlow concentration in the air in the alveoli and a high\\nconcentration in the blood in the pulmonary capillar-\\nies. These gases diffuse in opposite directions, each\\nmoving from where there is more to where there is\\nless. Oxygen diffuses from the air to the blood to be\\ncirculated throughout the body. Carbon dioxide dif-\\nfuses from the blood to the air to be exhaled.\\nOSMOSIS\\nOsmosis may be simply deﬁned as the diffusion of\\nwater through a selectively permeable membrane.\\nThat is, water will move from an area with more water\\npresent to an area with less water. Another way to say\\nthis is that water will naturally tend to move to an area\\nwhere there is more dissolved material, such as salt or\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:42 AM  Page 52'),\n",

If a 2% salt solution and a 6% salt solution are\\nseparated by a membrane allowing water but not salt\\nto pass through it, water will diffuse from the 2% salt\\nsolution to the 6% salt solution. The result is that the\\n2% solution will become more concentrated, and the\\n6% solution will become more dilute.\\nIn the body, the cells lining the small intestine\\nabsorb water from digested food by osmosis. These\\ncells have ﬁrst absorbed salts, have become more\\n“salty,” and water follows salt into the cells (see Fig.\\n3–3). The process of osmosis also takes place in the\\nkidneys, which reabsorb large amounts of water (many\\ngallons each day) to prevent its loss in urine. Box 3–1:\\nT erminology of Solutions lists some terminology we\\nuse when discussing solutions and the effects of vari-\\nous solutions on cells.\\nCells 53\\nBOX 3–1 TERMINOLOGY OF SOLUTIONS\\nHuman cells or other body ﬂuids contain many dis-\\nsolved substances (called solutes) such as salts,\\nsugars, acids, and bases. The concentration of\\nsolutes in a ﬂuid creates the osmotic pressure of\\nthe solution, which in turn determines the move-\\nment of water through membranes.\\nAs an example here, we will use sodium chloride\\n(NaCl). Human cells have an NaCl concentration of\\n0.9%. With human cells as a reference point, the\\nrelative NaCl concentrations of other solutions may\\nbe described with the following terms:\\nIsotonic—a solution with the same salt concentra-\\ntion as in cells.\\nThe blood plasma is isotonic to red blood cells.\\nHypotonic—a solution with a lower salt concentra-\\ntion than in cells.\\nDistilled water (0% salt) is hypotonic to human\\ncells.\\nHypertonic—a solution with a higher salt concen-\\ntration than in cells.\\nSeawater (3% salt) is hypertonic to human cells.\\nRefer now to the diagrams shown in Box\\nFigure 3–A of red blood cells(RBCs) in each\\nof these different types of solutions, and\\nnote the effect of each on osmosis:\\n• When RBCs are in plasma, water moves into\\nand out of them at equal rates, and the cells\\nremain normal in size and water content.\\n• If RBCs are placed in distilled water, more\\nwater will enter the cells than leave, and the\\ncells will swell and eventually burst.\\n• If RBCs are placed in seawater, more water will\\nleave the cells than enter, and the cells will\\nshrivel and die.\\nThis knowledge of osmotic pressure is used\\nwhen replacement ﬂuids are needed for a patient\\nwho has become dehydrated. Isotonic solutions\\nare usually used; normal saline and Ringer’s solu-\\ntion are examples. These will provide rehydration\\nwithout causing osmotic damage to cells or\\nextensive shifts of ﬂuid between the blood and\\ntissues.\\nBox Figure 3–A Red blood cells in different solutions and the effect of osmosis in each.\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:42 AM  Page 53'),\n",

In facili-\\ntated diffusion, molecules move through a membrane\\nfrom an area of greater concentration to an area of\\nlesser concentration, but they need some help to do\\nthis.\\nIn the body, our cells must take in glucose to use for\\nATP production. Glucose, however, will not diffuse\\nthrough most cell membranes by itself, even if there is\\nmore outside the cell than inside. Diffusion of glucose\\ninto most cells requires a glucose transporter, which\\nmay also be called a carrier enzyme . These trans-\\nporters are proteins that are part of the cell mem-\\nbrane. Glucose bonds to the transporter (see Fig. 3–3),\\nand by doing so changes the shape of the protein. This\\nphysical change propels the glucose into the interior\\nof the cell. Other transporters are speciﬁc for other\\norganic molecules such as amino acids.\\nACTIVE TRANSPORT\\nActive transport requires the energy of ATP to move\\nmolecules from an area of lesser concentration to an\\narea of greater concentration. Notice that this is the\\nopposite of diffusion, in which the free energy of mol-\\necules causes them to move to where there are fewer\\nof them. Active transport is therefore said to be move-\\nment against a concentration gradient.\\nIn the body, nerve cells and muscle cells have\\n“sodium pumps” to move sodium ions (Na\\n/H11001) out of\\nthe cells. Sodium ions are more abundant outside the\\ncells, and they constantly diffuse into the cell (through\\nspeciﬁc diffusion channels), their area of lesser con-\\ncentration (see Fig. 3–3). Without the sodium pumps\\nto return them outside, the incoming sodium ions\\nwould bring about an unwanted nerve impulse or\\nmuscle contraction. Nerve and muscle cells constantly\\nproduce ATP to keep their sodium pumps (and simi-\\nlar potassium pumps) working and prevent sponta-\\nneous impulses.\\nAnother example of active transport is the absorp-\\ntion of glucose and amino acids by the cells lining\\nthe small intestine. The cells use ATP to absorb these\\nnutrients from digested food, even when their intra-\\ncellular concentration becomes greater than their\\nextracellular concentration.\\nFILTRATION\\nThe process of ﬁltration also requires energy, but the\\nenergy needed does not come directly from ATP . It is\\nthe energy of mechanical pressure. Filtration means\\nthat water and dissolved materials are forced through\\na membrane from an area of higher pressure to an area\\nof lower pressure.\\nIn the body, blood pressure is created by the\\n54 Cells\\nTable 3–2 CELLULAR TRANSPORT MECHANISMS\\nMechanism Deﬁnition Example in the Body\\nDiffusion\\nOsmosis\\nFacilitated diffusion\\nActive transport\\nFiltration\\nPhagocytosis\\nPinocytosis\\nMovement of molecules from an area of\\ngreater concentration to an area of\\nlesser concentration.\\nThe diffusion of water.\\nCarrier and transporter enzymes move mole-\\ncules across cell membranes.\\nMovement of molecules from an area of\\nlesser concentration to an area of greater\\nconcentration (requires ATP).\\nMovement of water and dissolved substances\\nfrom an area of higher pressure to an area\\nof lower pressure (blood pressure).\\nA moving cell engulfs something.\\nA stationary cell engulfs something.\\nExchange of gases in the lungs or body tissues.\\nAbsorption of water by the small intestine\\nor kidneys.\\nIntake of glucose by most cells.\\nAbsorption of amino acids and glucose from food\\nby the cells of the small intestine.\\nSodium and potassium pumps in muscle and\\nnerve cells.\\nFormation of tissue ﬂuid; the ﬁrst step in the for-\\nmation of urine.\\nWhite blood cells engulf bacteria.\\nCells of the kidney tubules reabsorb small proteins.\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:42 AM  Page 54'),\n",

The\\nuprights of the ladder are made of alternating phos-\\nphate groups and deoxyribose sugar molecules. The\\nrungs of the ladder are made of the four nitrogenous\\nbases, always found in complementary pairs: adenine\\nwith thymine (A–T) and guanine with cytosine (G–C).\\nAlthough DNA contains just these four bases, the\\nbases may be arranged in many different sequences\\n(reading up or down the ladder). It is the sequence of\\nbases, the sequence of A, T , C, and G, that is the\\ngenetic code. The DNA of our 46 chromosomes may\\nalso be called our genome, which is the term for the\\ntotal genetic information in a particular species. The\\nhuman genome is believed to contain about 3 billion\\nbase pairs, and the number of our genes is now esti-\\nmated to be between 20,000 and 25,000 (or perhaps as\\nmany as 30,000, but much lower than previously\\nthought).\\n56 Cells\\nTable 3–3 PROTEIN SYNTHESIS\\nMolecule or Organelle Function\\nDNA\\nmRNA (messenger RNA)\\nRibosomes\\ntRNA (transfer RNA)\\n• A double strand (helix) of nucleotides that is the genetic code in the chromosomes\\nof cells.\\n• A gene is the sequence of bases (segment of DNA) that is the code for one protein.\\n• A single strand of nucleotides formed as a complementary copy of a gene in the DNA.\\n• Now contains the triplet code: three bases is the code for one amino acid (a codon).\\n• Leaves the DNA in the nucleus, enters the cytoplasm of the cell, and becomes\\nattached to ribosomes.\\n• The cell organelles that are the site of protein synthesis.\\n• Attach the mRNA molecule.\\n• Contain enzymes to form peptide bonds between amino acids.\\n• Picks up amino acids (from food) in the cytoplasm and transports them to their proper\\nsites (triplets) along the mRNA molecule; has anticodons to match mRNA codons.\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 56'),\n",

Although these functions of RNA\\nare essential for us, they too are beyond the scope of\\nour book, so the roles of RNA in the process of pro-\\ntein synthesis will be our focus.\\nThe transcription and translation of the genetic\\ncode in DNA into proteins require RNA. DNA is\\nfound in the chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell,\\nbut protein synthesis takes place on the ribosomes in\\nthe cytoplasm. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the\\nintermediary molecule between these two sites.\\nWhen a protein is to be made, the segment of DNA\\nthat is its gene uncoils, and the hydrogen bonds\\nbetween the base pairs break (see Fig. 3–4). Within\\nthe nucleus are RNA nucleotides (A, C, G, U) and\\nenzymes to construct a single strand of nucleotides\\nthat is a complementary copy of half the DNA gene\\n(with uracil in place of thymine). This process is tran-\\nscription, or copying, and the copy of the gene is\\nmRNA, which now has the codons for the amino acids\\nof the protein, and then separates from the DNA. The\\ngene coils back into the double helix, and the mRNA\\nleaves the nucleus, enters the cytoplasm, and becomes\\nattached to ribosomes.\\nAs the copy of the gene, mRNA is a series of triplets\\nof bases; each triplet is a codon, the code for one\\namino acid. Another type of RNA, called transfer\\nRNA (tRNA), is also found in the cytoplasm. Each\\ntRNA molecule has an anticodon, a triplet comple-\\nmentary to a triplet on the mRNA. The tRNA\\nmolecules pick up speciﬁc amino acids (which have\\ncome from protein in our food) and bring them to\\ntheir proper triplets on the mRNA. This process is\\ntranslation; that is, it is as if we are translating from\\none language to another—the language of nucleotide\\nbases to that of amino acids. The ribosomes contain\\nenzymes to catalyze the formation of peptide bonds\\nbetween the amino acids. When an amino acid has\\nbeen brought to each triplet on the mRNA, and\\nall peptide bonds have been formed, the protein is\\nﬁnished.\\nThe protein then leaves the ribosomes and may be\\ntransported by the endoplasmic reticulum to wherever\\nit is needed in the cell, or it may be packaged by the\\nGolgi apparatus for secretion from the cell. A sum-\\nmary of the process of protein synthesis is found in\\nT able 3–3.\\nThus, the expression of the genetic code may be\\ndescribed by the following sequence:\\nEach of us is the sum total of our genetic charac-\\nteristics. Blood type, hair color, muscle proteins, nerve\\ncells, and thousands of other aspects of our structure\\nand functioning have their basis in the genetic code of\\nDNA.\\nIf there is a “mistake” in the DNA, that is, incorrect\\nbases or triplets of bases, this mistake will be copied by\\nthe mRNA. The result is the formation of a malfunc-\\ntioning or non-functioning protein. This is called a\\ngenetic or hereditary disease, and a speciﬁc example\\nis described in Box 3–2: Genetic Disease—Sickle-Cell\\nAnemia.\\nDNA RNA Proteins:\\nStructural Enzymes\\nCatalyze Reactions\\nHereditary Characteristics\\nProteins\\n58 Cells\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 58'),\n",

Normal\\nhemoglobin, called hemoglobin A (HbA), is a pro-\\ntein made of two alpha chains (141 amino acids\\neach) and two beta chains (146 amino acids each).\\nIn sickle-cell hemoglobin (HbS), the sixth amino\\nacid in each beta chain is incorrect; valine instead of\\nthe glutamic acid found in HbA. This difference\\nseems minor—only 2 incorrect amino acids out of\\nmore than 500—but the consequences for the per-\\nson are very serious.\\nHbS has a great tendency to crystallize when\\noxygen levels are low, as is true in capillaries. When\\nHbS crystallizes, the red blood cells are deformed\\ninto crescents (sickles) and other irregular shapes.\\nThese irregular, rigid red blood cells clog and rup-\\nture capillaries, causing internal bleeding and\\nsevere pain. These cells are also fragile and break up\\neasily, leading to anemia and hypoxia (lack of oxy-\\ngen). Treatment of this disease has improved\\ngreatly, but it is still incurable.\\nWhat has happened to cause the formation of\\nHbS rather than HbA? Hemoglobin is a protein; the\\ngene for its beta chain is in DNA (chromosome 11).\\nOne amino acid in the beta chains is incorrect,\\ntherefore, one triplet in its DNA gene must be, and\\nis, incorrect. This mistake is copied by mRNA in the\\ncells of the red bone marrow, and HbS is synthe-\\nsized in red blood cells.\\nSickle-cell anemia is a recessive genetic disease,\\nwhich means that a person with one gene for HbS\\nand one gene for HbA will have “sickle-cell trait.”\\nSuch a person usually will not have the severe\\neffects of sickle-cell anemia, but may pass the gene\\nfor HbS to children. It is estimated that 9% of\\nAfrican-Americans have sickle-cell trait and about\\n1% have sickle-cell anemia.\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 59'),\n",

There are two types of cell division, mitosis and\\nmeiosis. Although both types involve cell reproduc-\\ntion, their purposes are very different.\\nMITOSIS\\nEach of us began life as one cell, a fertilized egg. Each\\nof us now consists of billions of cells produced by the\\nprocess of mitosis. In mitosis, one cell with the\\ndiploid number of chromosomes (the usual number,\\n46 for people) divides into two identical cells, each\\nwith the diploid number of chromosomes. This pro-\\nduction of identical cells is necessary for the growth of\\nthe organism and for repair of tissues (see also Box\\n3–3: Abnormal Cellular Functioning—Cancer).\\nBefore mitosis can take place, a cell must have two\\ncomplete sets of chromosomes, because each new cell\\nmust have the diploid number. The process of DNA\\nreplication enables each chromosome (in the form of\\nchromatin) to make a copy of itself. The time during\\nwhich this takes place is called interphase, the time\\nbetween mitotic divisions. Although interphase is\\nsometimes referred to as the resting stage, resting\\nmeans “not dividing” rather than “inactive.” The cell\\nis quite actively producing a second set of chromo-\\nsomes and storing energy in ATP .\\nThe long, thin, and invisible chromatin molecules\\nthen begin to coil very precisely and extensively, and if\\nwe were looking at the nucleus of a living cell under a\\nmicroscope, we would see the duplicated chromo-\\nsomes appear. Each would look somewhat like the let-\\nter X, because the original DNA molecule and its copy\\n(now called chromatids) are still attached.\\nThe stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase,\\nanaphase, and telophase. What happens in each of\\nthese stages is described in T able 3–4. As you read the\\nevents of each stage, refer to Fig. 3–5, which depicts\\nmitosis in a cell with a diploid number of four.\\nAs mentioned previously, mitosis is essential for\\nrepair of tissues, to replace damaged or dead cells.\\nSome examples may help illustrate this. In several\\nareas of the body, mitosis takes place constantly. These\\nsites include the epidermis of the skin, the stomach\\nlining, and the red bone marrow. For each of these\\nsites, there is a speciﬁc reason why this constant mito-\\nsis is necessary.\\nWhat happens to the surface of the skin? The dead,\\nouter cells are worn off by contact with the environ-\\nment. Mitosis of the epidermal cells in the lower liv-\\ning layer replaces these cells, and the epidermis\\nmaintains its normal thickness.\\nThe stomach lining, although internal, is also con-\\nstantly worn away. Gastric juice, especially hydrochlo-\\nric acid, is very damaging to cells. Rapid mitosis of the\\nseveral kinds of lining cells replaces damaged cells and\\nkeeps the stomach lining intact.\\nOne of the functions of red bone marrow is the\\nproduction of red blood cells. Because red blood cells\\nhave a life span of only about 120 days, new ones are\\nneeded to replace the older ones that die. Very rapid\\nmitosis in the red bone marrow produces approxi-\\nmately 2 million new red blood cells every second.\\nThese dividing cells in the red bone marrow are\\namong the stem cells present in the body. A stem cell\\nis an unspecialized cell that may develop into several\\ndifferent kinds of cells. Stem cells in the red bone mar-\\nrow may become red blood cells, white blood cells, or\\nplatelets. These marrow stem cells are often called\\nadult stem cells, and many, if not all, of the body’s\\norgans have such cells. Embryonic stem cells will be\\ndescribed in a later chapter; these are cells in which all\\nof the DNA still has the potential to be active. They\\nmay become any of the more than 200 different kinds\\nof human cells. The stem cells found in the umbilical\\ncords of newborns are between the adult and embry-\\nonic cells in terms of their potential.\\nIt is also important to be aware of the areas of the\\nbody where mitosis does not take place. In an adult,\\nmost muscle cells and neurons (nerve cells) do not\\nreproduce themselves. If they die, their functions are\\nalso lost. Someone whose spinal cord has been severed\\nwill have paralysis and loss of sensation below the level\\nof the injury. The spinal cord neurons do not undergo\\nmitosis to replace the ones that were lost, and such an\\ninjury is permanent.\\nSkeletal muscle cells are capable of limited mitosis\\nfor repair. The heart is made of cardiac muscle cells,\\nwhich, like neurons, seem to be incapable of mitosis. A\\nheart attack (myocardial infarction) means that a por-\\ntion of cardiac muscle dies because of lack of oxygen.\\nThese cells are not replaced, and the heart will be a\\nless effective pump. If a large enough area of the heart\\nmuscle dies, the heart attack may be fatal.\\nSome research has found evidence for the potential\\nfor mitosis after damage in both the central nervous\\nsystem and the heart. Such cell division may be that of\\nneurons or muscle cells that were stimulated to divide\\n60 Cells\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 60'),\n",

Carriers of\\nhepatitis B virus, for example, are more likely to\\ndevelop primary liver cancer than are people who\\nhave never been exposed to this virus. Research has\\ndiscovered two genes, one on chromosome 2 and\\nthe other on chromosome 3, that contribute to a\\ncertain form of colon cancer. Both of these genes\\nare the codes for proteins that correct the “mis-\\ntakes” that may occur when the new DNA is syn-\\nthesized. When these repair proteins do not\\nfunction properly, the mistakes (mutations) in the\\nDNA lead to the synthesis of yet other faulty pro-\\nteins that impair the functioning of the cell and pre-\\ndispose it to becoming malignant.\\nOnce cells have become malignant, their func-\\ntioning cannot return to normal, and though the\\nimmune system will often destroy such cells, some-\\ntimes it does not, especially as we get older.\\nTherefore, the treatments for cancer are directed at\\nremoving or destroying the abnormal cells. Surgery\\nto remove tumors, radiation to destroy cells, and\\nchemotherapy to stop cell division or interfere\\nwith other aspects of cell metabolism are all aspects\\nof cancer treatment.\\nNew chemotherapy drugs are becoming more\\nspeciﬁc, with very precise targets. For example, the\\ncells of several types of solid-tumor cancers have\\nbeen found to have mutations in the gene for the\\ncell membrane receptor for a natural growth factor\\n(epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR). These\\naltered receptors, when triggered by their usual\\ngrowth factor, then cause the cell to divide uncon-\\ntrollably, an abnormal response. Medications that\\ntarget only these altered receptors have already\\nbeen developed for some forms of lung cancer and\\nbreast cancer. Not only do they show promise in\\ntreating the cancer, they do not have the side\\neffects of other forms of chemotherapy.\\nThere are more than 200 different types of cancer,\\nall of which are characterized by abnormal cellular\\nfunctioning. Normally, our cells undergo mitosis\\nonly when necessary and stop when appropriate. A\\ncut in the skin, for example, is repaired by mitosis,\\nusually without formation of excess tissue. The new\\ncells ﬁll in the damaged area, and mitosis slows\\nwhen the cells make contact with surrounding cells.\\nThis is called contact inhibition, which limits the\\nnew tissue to just what is needed. Malignant\\n(cancer) cells, however, are characterized by uncon-\\ntrolled cell division. Our cells are genetically pro-\\ngrammed to have particular life spans and to divide\\nor die. One gene is known to act as a brake on cell\\ndivision; another gene enables cells to live indeﬁ-\\nnitely, beyond their normal life span, and to keep\\ndividing. Any imbalance in the activity of these\\ngenes may lead to abnormal cell division. Such cells\\nare not inhibited by contact with other cells, keep\\ndividing, and tend to spread.\\nA malignant tumor begins in a primary site such\\nas the colon, then may spread or metastasize. Often\\nthe malignant cells are carried by the lymph or\\nblood to other organs such as the liver, where sec-\\nondary tumors develop. Metastasis is characteris-\\ntic only of malignant cells; benign tumors do not\\nmetastasize but remain localized in their primary\\nsite.\\nWhat causes normal cells to become malignant?\\nAt present, we have only partial answers. A malig-\\nnant cell is created by a mutation, a genetic\\nchange that brings about abnormal cell functions\\nor responses and often leads to a series of muta-\\ntions. Environmental substances that cause muta-\\ntions are called carcinogens. One example is the\\ntar found in cigarette smoke, which is deﬁnitely a\\ncause of lung cancer. Ultraviolet light may also\\ncause mutations, especially in skin that is overex-\\nposed to sunlight. For a few speciﬁc kinds of cancer,\\n03Scanlon(p3)-ch03  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 61'),\n",

Clinical manifesta-\\ntions of impaired chaperones include cataracts (see\\nBox 9–1) and neurodegenerative diseases such as\\nAlzheimer’s disease (see Box 8–6), Parkinson’s dis-\\nease (see Box 8–7), and Huntington’s disease (see\\nT able 21–4).\\nMuch about the chemistry of the aging process\\nremains a mystery, though we can describe what hap-\\npens to organs and to the body as a whole.

The\\ntypes of connective tissue include areolar, adipose,\\nﬁbrous, and elastic tissue as well as blood, bone, and\\ncartilage; these are summarized in T able 4–2. A char-\\nacteristic that all connective tissues have in common is\\nthe presence of a matrix in addition to cells. The\\nmatrix is a structural network or solution of non-\\nliving intercellular material. Each connective tissue\\nhas its own speciﬁc kind of matrix. The matrix of\\nblood, for example, is blood plasma, which is mostly\\nwater. The matrix of bone is made primarily of cal-\\ncium salts, which are hard and strong.

Blood consists of cells\\nand plasma; cells are the living portion. The matrix of\\nblood is plasma, which is about 52% to 62% of the\\ntotal blood volume in the body. The water of plasma\\ncontains dissolved salts, nutrients, gases, and waste\\nproducts. As you might expect, one of the primary\\nfunctions of plasma is transport of these materials\\nwithin the body.\\nBlood cells are produced from stem cells in the red\\nbone marrow, the body’s primary hemopoietic tissue\\n(blood-forming tissue), which is found in ﬂat and\\nirregular bones such as the hip bone and vertebrae.\\nThe blood cells are red blood cells, platelets, and the\\nfive kinds of white blood cells: neutrophils,\\neosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes\\n(see Figs. 4–4 and 11–2).

Bacteria and viruses\\nalso enter with the air we breathe and the food we eat,\\nand some may get through the epithelial linings of the\\nrespiratory and digestive tracts and cause tissue dam-\\nage. Areolar connective tissue with its mast cells and\\nmany white blood cells is strategically placed to inter-\\ncept pathogens before they get to the blood and circu-\\nlate throughout the body.\\nADIPOSE TISSUE\\nThe cells of adipose tissue are called adipocytes and\\nare specialized to store fat in microscopic droplets.\\nT rue fats are the chemical form of long-term energy\\nstorage. Excess nutrients have calories that are not\\nwasted but are converted to fat to be stored for use\\nwhen food intake decreases. Any form of excess calo-\\nries, whether in the form of fats, carbohydrates, or\\namino acids from protein, may be changed to triglyc-\\nerides and stored. The amount of matrix in adipose\\ntissue is small and consists of tissue ﬂuid and a few col-\\nlagen ﬁbers (see Fig. 4–4).\\nMost fat is stored subcutaneously in the areolar\\nconnective tissue between the dermis and the muscles.\\nThis layer varies in thickness among individuals; the\\nmore excess calories consumed, the thicker the layer.\\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, adipose tissue also cush-\\nions organs such as the eyes and kidneys.\\nRecent research has discovered that adipose tissue\\ndoes much more than provide a cushion or store\\nenergy. Adipose tissue is now considered an endocrine\\ntissue, because it produces at least one hormone.\\nLeptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone secreted\\nby adipocytes to signal the hypothalamus in the brain\\nthat fat storage is sufficient (see also Chapter 17).\\nWhen leptin secretion diminishes, appetite increases.\\nAdipocytes secrete at least two chemicals that help\\nregulate the use of insulin in glucose and fat metabo-\\nlism. Adipose tissue is also involved in inﬂammation,\\nthe body’s ﬁrst response to injury, in that it produces\\ncytokines, chemicals that activate white blood cells.\\nOur adipose tissue is not simply an inert depository of\\n76 Tissues and Membranes\\nFibrous tissueFibrous tissue\\nCollagen\\n fibers\\nFibroblasts\\nExample: Trachea\\n(approximately 430X)\\nB\\nA\\nC\\n(Approximately 430X)\\nHaversian canal\\nCanaliculi\\nMatrix\\nOsteocytes\\nBone\\nChondrocytes\\nMatrix\\nCartilage\\nExample: Tendons\\n(approximately 430X)\\nFigure 4–5.

One of its locations is in the walls\\nof large arteries. These vessels are stretched when the\\nheart contracts and pumps blood, then they recoil, or\\nsnap back, when the heart relaxes.

Vitamin C has several functions, and an im-\\nportant one is the synthesis of collagen.\\nImagine the protein collagen as a ladder with\\nthree uprights and rungs that connect adjacent\\nuprights. Vitamin C is essential for forming the\\n“rungs,” without which the uprights will not stay\\ntogether as a strong unit. Collagen formed in the\\nabsence of vitamin C is weak, and the effects of\\nweak collagen are dramatically seen in the disease\\ncalled scurvy.\\nIn 1753 James Lind, a Scottish surgeon, recom-\\nmended to the British Navy that lime juice be taken\\non long voyages to prevent scurvy among the\\nsailors. Scurvy is characterized by bleeding gums\\nand loss of teeth, poor healing of wounds, fractures,\\nand bleeding in the skin, joints, and elsewhere in\\nthe body. The lime juice did prevent this potentially\\nfatal disease, as did consumption of fresh fruits and\\nvegetables, although at the time no one knew why.\\nVitamin C was ﬁnally isolated in the laboratory in\\n1928.\\nBOX 4–3 COSMETIC COLLAGEN\\nsystem as foreign tissue. More seriously, an autoim-\\nmune response may be triggered in some individu-\\nals, and the immune system may begin to destroy\\nthe person’s own connective tissue.\\nIn an effort to avoid these problems, some cos-\\nmetic surgeons now use the person’s own collagen\\nand fat, which may be extracted from the thigh,\\nhip, or abdomen. The long-term consequences and\\noutcomes of such procedures have yet to be evalu-\\nated. We might remember that for many years the\\nuse of silicone injections had been considered safe.\\nSilicone injections are now banned by the FDA,\\nsince we now know that they carry signiﬁcant risk\\nof serious tissue damage.\\nCollagen is the protein that makes tendons, liga-\\nments, and other connective tissues strong.

In the shafts of long bones such as the\\nfemur, the osteocytes, matrix, and blood vessels are\\nin very precise arrangements called haversian sys-\\ntems or osteons (see Fig. 4–5). Bone has a good blood\\nsupply, which enables it to serve as a storage site for\\ncalcium and to repair itself relatively rapidly after a\\nsimple fracture. Some bones, such as the sternum\\n(breastbone) and pelvic bone, contain red bone mar-\\nrow, the primary hemopoietic tissue that produces\\nblood cells.\\nOther functions of bone tissue are related to the\\nstrength of bone matrix. The skeleton supports the\\nbody, and some bones protect internal organs from\\nmechanical injury. A more complete discussion of\\nbone is found in Chapter 6.\\nCARTILAGE\\nThe protein–carbohydrate matrix of cartilage does\\nnot contain calcium salts, and also differs from that of\\nbone in that it contains more water, which makes it\\nresilient. It is ﬁrm, yet smooth and ﬂexible. Cartilage\\nis found on the joint surfaces of bones, where its\\nsmooth surface helps prevent friction. The tip of the\\nnose and external ear are supported by ﬂexible carti-\\nlage. The wall of the trachea, the airway to the lungs,\\ncontains ﬁrm rings of cartilage to maintain an open air\\npassageway. Discs of cartilage are found between the\\nvertebrae of the spine. Here the cartilage is a ﬁrm\\ncushion; it absorbs shock and permits movement.\\nWithin the cartilage matrix are the chondrocytes,\\nor cartilage cells (see Fig. 4–5). There are no capillar-\\nies within the cartilage matrix, so these cells are nour-\\nished by diffusion through the matrix, a slow process.\\nThis becomes clinically important when cartilage is\\ndamaged, for repair will take place very slowly or not\\nat all. Athletes sometimes damage cartilage within the\\nknee joint. Such damaged cartilage is usually surgically\\nremoved in order to preserve as much joint mobility as\\npossible.\\nMUSCLE TISSUE\\nMuscle tissue is specialized for contraction. When\\nmuscle cells contract, they shorten and bring about\\nsome type of movement. There are three types of\\nmuscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac (T able\\n4–3). The movements each can produce have very dif-\\nferent purposes.\\nSKELETAL MUSCLE\\nSkeletal muscle may also be called striated muscle or\\nvoluntary muscle. Each name describes a particular\\naspect of this tissue, as you will see. The skeletal mus-\\ncle cells are cylindrical, have several nuclei each, and\\nappear striated, or striped (Fig. 4–6). The striations\\nare the result of the precise arrangement of the con-\\ntracting proteins within the cells.\\nSkeletal muscle tissue makes up the muscles that\\nare attached to bones. These muscles are supplied\\nwith motor nerves, and thus move the skeleton. They\\nalso produce a signiﬁcant amount of heat, which is\\nimportant to help maintain the body’s constant tem-\\nperature. Each muscle cell has its own motor nerve\\nending. The nerve impulses that can then travel to the\\nmuscles are essential to cause contraction. Although\\nwe do not have to consciously plan all our movements,\\nthe nerve impulses for them originate in the cere-\\nbrum, the “thinking” part of the brain.\\nLet us return to the three names for this tissue:\\n“skeletal” describes its location, “striated” describes its\\nappearance, and “voluntary” describes how it func-\\ntions. The skeletal muscles and their functioning are\\nthe subject of Chapter 7.\\nSMOOTH MUSCLE\\nSmooth muscle may also be called involuntary mus-\\ncle or visceral muscle. The cells of smooth muscle\\nhave tapered ends, a single nucleus, and no striations\\n(see Fig. 4–6). Although nerve impulses do bring\\nabout contractions, this is not something most of us\\ncan control, hence the name involuntary. The term vis-\\nceral refers to internal organs, many of which contain\\nsmooth muscle. The functions of smooth muscle are\\nactually functions of the organs in which the muscle is\\nfound.\\nIn the stomach and intestines, smooth muscle con-\\ntracts in waves called peristalsis to propel food\\nthrough the digestive tract. In the walls of arteries and\\nveins, smooth muscle constricts or dilates the vessels\\nto maintain normal blood pressure. The iris of the eye\\nhas two sets of smooth muscle ﬁbers to constrict or\\ndilate the pupil, which regulates the amount of light\\nthat strikes the retina.\\nOther functions of smooth muscle are mentioned\\nin later chapters. This is an important tissue that you\\nwill come across again and again in our study of the\\nhuman body.\\nTissues and Membranes 79\\n04Scanlon(p3)-ch04  8/17/06  10:43 AM  Page 79'),\n",

These\\ninterlocking folds are called intercalated discs , and\\npermit the electrical impulses of muscle contraction to\\npass swiftly from cell to cell. This enables the heart to\\nbeat in a very precise wave of contraction from the\\nupper chambers to the lower chambers. Cardiac mus-\\ncle as a whole is called the myocardium, and forms\\nthe walls of the four chambers of the heart. Its func-\\ntion, therefore, is the function of the heart, to pump\\nblood. The contractions of the myocardium create\\nblood pressure and keep blood circulating throughout\\nthe body, so that the blood can carry out its many\\nfunctions.\\nCardiac muscle cells have the ability to contract by\\nthemselves. Thus the heart maintains its own beat.\\nThe role of nerve impulses is to increase or decrease\\nthe heart rate, depending upon whatever is needed\\nby the body in a particular situation. We will return to\\nthe heart in Chapter 12.\\nNERVE TISSUE\\nNerve tissue consists of nerve cells called neurons\\nand some specialized cells found only in the nervous\\nsystem. The nervous system has two divisions: the\\ncentral nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral\\nnervous system (PNS). The brain and spinal cord are\\nthe organs of the CNS. They are made of neurons and\\nspecialized cells called neuroglia. The CNS and the\\nneuroglia are discussed in detail in Chapter 8. The\\nPNS consists of all of the nerves that emerge from\\nthe CNS and supply the rest of the body. These nerves\\nare made of neurons and specialized cells called\\nSchwann cells. The Schwann cells form the myelin\\nsheath to electrically insulate neurons.\\nNeurons are capable of generating and transmit-\\nting electrochemical impulses. There are many differ-\\nent kinds of neurons, but they all have the same basic\\nstructure (Fig. 4–7). The cell body contains the\\nnucleus and is essential for the continuing life of the\\nneuron. An axon is a process (the term “process” here\\nmeans “something that sticks out,” a cellular exten-\\nsion) that carries impulses away from the cell body; a\\nneuron has only one axon. Dendrites are processes\\nthat carry impulses toward the cell body; a neuron\\nmay have several dendrites. A nerve impulse travels\\nalong the cell membrane of a neuron, and is electrical,\\nbut where neurons meet there is a small space called a\\nsynapse, which an electrical impulse cannot cross. At\\na synapse, between the axon of one neuron and the\\ndendrite or cell body of the next neuron, impulse\\ntransmission depends upon chemicals called neuro-\\ntransmitters.

Many membranes produce secre-\\ntions that have speciﬁc functions. The two major cat-\\negories of membranes are epithelial membranes and\\nconnective tissue membranes.\\nEPITHELIAL MEMBRANES\\nThere are two types of epithelial membranes, serous\\nand mucous. Each type is found in speciﬁc locations\\nwithin the body and secretes a ﬂuid. These ﬂuids are\\ncalled serous ﬂuid and mucus.\\nSerous Membranes\\nSerous membranes are sheets of simple squamous\\nepithelium that line some closed body cavities and\\ncover the organs in these cavities (Fig. 4–8). The\\npleural membranes are the serous membranes of the\\nthoracic cavity. The parietal pleura lines the chest wall\\nand the visceral pleura covers the lungs. (Notice that\\nline means “on the inside” and cover means “on the\\noutside.” These terms cannot be used interchangeably,\\nbecause each indicates a different location.) The pleu-\\nral membranes secrete serous ﬂuid , which prevents\\nfriction between them as the lungs expand and recoil\\nduring breathing.\\nThe heart, in the thoracic cavity between the lungs,\\nhas its own set of serous membranes. The parietal\\npericardium lines the ﬁbrous pericardium (a connec-\\ntive tissue membrane), and the visceral pericardium,\\nor epicardium, is on the surface of the heart muscle\\n(see also Fig. 12–1). Serous ﬂuid is produced to pre-\\nvent friction as the heart beats.\\nIn the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum is the\\nserous membrane that lines the cavity. The mesen-\\ntery, or visceral peritoneum, is folded over and covers\\nthe abdominal organs. Here, the serous ﬂuid prevents\\nfriction as the stomach and intestines contract and\\nslide against other organs (see also Fig. 16–4).\\nMucous Membranes\\nMucous membranes line the body tracts (systems)\\nthat have openings to the environment. These are the\\nrespiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts.\\nThe epithelium of a mucous membrane ( mucosa)\\nvaries with the different organs involved. The mucosa\\nof the esophagus and of the vagina is stratiﬁed squa-\\nmous epithelium; the mucosa of the trachea is ciliated\\nepithelium; the mucosa of the stomach is columnar\\nepithelium.\\n82 Tissues and Membranes\\nFigure 4–7.

The skin is\\nmade of several different tissue types and is considered\\nan organ. Because the skin covers the surface of the\\nbody, one of its functions is readily apparent: It sepa-\\nrates the internal environment of the body from the\\nexternal environment and prevents the entry of many\\nharmful substances. The subcutaneous tissue directly\\nunderneath the skin connects it to the muscles and has\\nother functions as well.\\nTHE SKIN\\nThe two major layers of the skin are the outer\\nepidermis and the inner dermis. Each of these layers\\nis made of different tissues and has very different func-\\ntions.\\nEPIDERMIS\\nThe epidermis is made of stratiﬁed squamous kera-\\ntinizing epithelial tissue and is thickest on the palms\\nand soles. The cells that are most abundant are called\\nkeratinocytes, and there are no capillaries present\\nbetween them. Although the epidermis may be further\\nsubdivided into four or ﬁve sublayers, two of these are\\nof greatest importance: the innermost layer, the stra-\\ntum germinativum, and the outermost layer, the stra-\\ntum corneum (Fig. 5–1).\\nStratum Germinativum\\nThe stratum germinativum may also be called the\\nstratum basale. Each name tells us something about\\nthis layer. T o germinate means “to sprout” or “to\\ngrow.” Basal means the “base” or “lowest part.” The\\nstratum germinativum is the base of the epidermis, the\\ninnermost layer in which mitosis takes place. New\\ncells are continually being produced, pushing the\\nolder cells toward the skin surface. These cells pro-\\nduce the protein keratin, and as they get farther away\\nfrom the capillaries in the dermis, they die. As dead\\ncells are worn off the skin’s surface, they are replaced\\nby cells from the lower layers. Scattered among the\\nkeratinocytes of the stratum germinativum are very\\ndifferent cells called Merkel cells (or Merkel discs);\\nthese are receptors for the sense of touch (Fig. 5–2).\\nThe living keratinocytes are able to synthesize\\nantimicrobial peptides called defensins; these and\\nother chemicals are produced following any injury to\\nthe skin, as part of the process of inﬂammation.\\nDefensins rupture the membranes of pathogens such\\nas bacteria that may enter by way of breaks in the skin.\\nThe living portion of the epidermis also produces a\\nvitamin; the cells have a form of cholesterol that, on\\nexposure to ultraviolet light, is changed to vitamin D\\n(then modiﬁed by the liver and kidneys to the most\\nactive form, called 1,25-D, or calcitriol, which is con-\\nsidered a hormone). This is why vitamin D is some-\\ntimes referred to as the “sunshine vitamin.” People\\nwho do not get much sunlight depend more on nutri-\\ntional sources of vitamin D, such as fortiﬁed milk. But\\nsunlight is probably the best way to get vitamin D, and\\n15 minutes a day a few times a week is often enough.\\nVitamin D is important for the absorption of calcium\\nand phosphorus from food in the small intestine; this\\nfunction has been known for years. Recent research,\\nhowever, suggests that vitamin D is also involved in\\nmaintaining muscle strength, especially in elderly peo-\\nple, in the functioning of insulin, and in some immune\\nresponses, where it may be protective for some types\\nof cancer.\\nStratum Corneum\\nThe stratum corneum , the outermost epidermal\\nlayer, consists of many layers of dead cells; all that is\\nleft is their keratin. The protein keratin is relatively\\nwaterproof, and though the stratum corneum should\\nnot be thought of as a plastic bag encasing the body, it\\ndoes prevent most evaporation of body water. Also of\\nimportance, keratin prevents the entry of water. With-\\nout a waterproof stratum corneum, it would be impos-\\nsible to swim in a pool or even take a shower without\\ndamaging our cells.\\nThe stratum corneum is also a barrier to pathogens\\nand chemicals. Most bacteria and other microorgan-\\nisms cannot penetrate unbroken skin. The ﬂaking of\\ndead cells from the skin surface helps remove micro-\\norganisms, and the fatty acids in sebum help inhibit\\ntheir growth. Most chemicals, unless they are corro-\\nsive, will not get through unbroken skin to the living\\ntissue within. One painful exception is the sap of poi-\\nson ivy. This resin does penetrate the skin and initiates\\nan allergic reaction in susceptible people.

The severity of burns ranges from minor\\nto fatal, and the classiﬁcation of burns is based on\\nthe extent of damage.\\nFirst-Degree Burn—only the superﬁcial epidermis\\nis burned, and is painful but not blistered. Light-\\ncolored skin will appear red due to localized\\nvasodilation in the damaged area. Vasodilation is\\npart of the inﬂammatory response that brings more\\nblood to the injured site.\\nSecond-Degree Burn —deeper layers of the epi-\\ndermis are affected. Another aspect of inﬂam-\\nmation is that damaged cells release histamine,\\nwhich makes capillaries more permeable. More\\nplasma leaves these capillaries and becomes tissue\\nﬂuid, which collects at the burn site, creating blis-\\nters. The burned skin is often very painful.\\nThird-Degree Burn —the entire epidermis is\\ncharred or burned away, and the burn may extend\\ninto the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Often such\\na burn is not painful at ﬁrst, if the receptors in the\\ndermis have been destroyed.\\nExtensive third-degree burns are potentially life-\\nthreatening because of the loss of the stratum\\ncorneum. Without this natural barrier, living tissue is\\nexposed to the environment and is susceptible to\\ninfection and dehydration.\\nBacterial infection is a serious problem for burn\\npatients; the pathogens may get into the blood\\n(septicemia ) and quickly spread throughout\\nthe body. Dehydration may also be fatal if medical\\nintervention does not interrupt and correct the\\nfollowing sequence: Tissue ﬂuid evaporates from\\nthe burned surface, and more plasma is pulled\\nout of capillaries into the tissue spaces. As more\\nplasma is lost, blood volume and blood pressure\\ndecrease. This is called circulatory shock; eventu-\\nally the heart simply does not have enough blood\\nto pump, and heart failure is the cause of death. To\\nprevent these serious consequences, third-degree\\nburns are covered with donor skin or artiﬁcial skin\\nuntil skin grafts of the patient’s own skin can be put\\nin place.\\n(Continued on following page)\\n05Scanlon(p3)-ch05  8/17/06  10:44 AM  Page 92'),\n",

As more\\nmelanin is produced, it is taken in by the epidermal\\ncells as they are pushed toward the surface. This gives\\nthe skin a darker color, which prevents further expo-\\nsure of the living stratum germinativum to ultraviolet\\nrays. People with dark skin already have good protec-\\ntion against the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays;\\npeople with light skin do not (see Box 5–2: Preventing\\nSkin Cancer: Common Sense and Sunscreens).\\nMelanin also gives color to hair, though its protective\\nfunction is conﬁned to the hair of the head. T wo parts\\nof the eye obtain their color from melanin: the iris and\\nthe interior choroid layer of the eyeball (the eye is dis-\\ncussed in Chapter 9).The functions of the epidermis\\nand its cells are summarized in T able 5–1.\\n94 The Integumentary System\\nBOX 5–2 PREVENTING SKIN CANCER: COMMON SENSE AND SUNSCREENS\\nB\\nA\\nAnyone can get skin cancer, and the most impor-\\ntant factor is exposure to sunlight. Light-skinned\\npeople are, of course, more susceptible to the\\neffects of ultraviolet (UV) rays, which may trigger\\nmutations in living epidermal cells.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carci-\\nnoma (see A in Box Fig. 5–B) are the most common\\nforms of skin cancer. The lesions are visible as\\nchanges in the normal appearance of the skin, and\\na biopsy (microscopic examination of a tissue spec-\\nimen) is used to conﬁrm the diagnosis. These lesions\\nusually do not metastasize rapidly, and can be\\ncompletely removed using simple procedures\\nMalignant melanoma (see B in Box Fig. 5–B) is\\na more serious form of skin cancer, which begins in\\nmelanocytes. Any change in a pigmented spot or\\nmole (nevus) should prompt a person to see a doc-\\ntor. Melanoma is serious not because of its growth\\nin the skin, but because it may metastasize very\\nrapidly to the lungs, liver, or other vital organ.\\nResearchers are testing individualized vaccines for\\npeople who have had melanoma. The purpose of\\nthe vaccine is to stimulate the immune system\\nstrongly enough to prevent a second case, for such\\nrecurrences are often fatal.\\nAlthough the most common forms of skin cancer\\nare readily curable, prevention is a better strategy.\\nWe cannot, and we would not want to, stay out of\\nthe sun altogether (because sunlight may be the\\nbest way to get sufficient vitamin D), but we may\\nbe able to do so when sunlight is most damaging.\\nDuring the summer months, UV rays are especially\\nintense between 10 \\nA.M. and 2 P.M. If we are or\\nmust be outdoors during this time, dermatologists\\nrecommend use of a sunscreen.\\nSunscreens contain chemicals such as PABA\\n(para-amino benzoic acid) that block UV rays and\\nprevent them from damaging the epidermis. An\\nSPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher is con-\\nsidered good protection. Use of a sunscreen on\\nexposed skin not only helps prevent skin cancer but\\nalso prevents sunburn and its painful effects. It is\\nespecially important to prevent children from get-\\nting severely sunburned, because such burns have\\nbeen linked to the development of skin cancer years\\nlater.\\nBox Figure 5–B (A) Classic basal cell carcinoma on face.

Fibroblasts pro-\\nduce both collagen and elastin ﬁbers. Recall that col-\\nlagen ﬁbers are strong, and elastin ﬁbers are able to\\nrecoil after being stretched. Strength and elasticity are\\ntwo characteristics of the dermis. With increasing age,\\nhowever, the deterioration of the elastin ﬁbers causes\\nthe skin to lose its elasticity. We can all look forward\\nto at least a few wrinkles as we get older.\\nThe uneven junction of the dermis with the epider-\\nmis is called the papillary layer (see Fig. 5–1). Capil-\\nlaries are abundant here to nourish not only the\\ndermis but also the stratum germinativum. The epi-\\ndermis has no capillaries of its own, and the lower, liv-\\ning cells depend on the blood supply in the dermis for\\noxygen and nutrients.\\nWithin the dermis are the accessory skin structures:\\nhair and nail follicles, sensory receptors, and several\\ntypes of glands. Some of these project through the\\nepidermis to the skin surface, but their active portions\\nare in the dermis.\\nHair Follicles\\nHair follicles are made of epidermal tissue, and the\\ngrowth process of hair is very similar to growth of the\\nepidermis. At the base of a follicle is the hair root ,\\nwhich contains cells called the matrix, where mitosis\\ntakes place (Fig. 5–3). The new cells produce keratin,\\nget their color from melanin, then die and become\\nincorporated into the hair shaft , which is pushed\\ntoward the surface of the skin. The hair that we comb\\nand brush every day consists of dead, keratinized cells.\\nThe rate of hair growth averages 0.3 to 0.4 in./month\\n(8 to 10 mm).\\nCompared to some other mammals, humans do not\\nhave very much hair. The actual functions of human\\nhair are quite few. Eyelashes and eyebrows help to\\nkeep dust and perspiration out of the eyes, and the\\nhairs just inside the nostrils help to keep dust out of\\nthe nasal cavities. Hair of the scalp does provide insu-\\nlation from cold for the head. The hair on our bodies,\\nhowever, no longer serves this function, but we have\\nthe evolutionary remnants of it.

When stimulated by cold or\\nemotions such as fear, these muscles pull the hair fol-\\nlicles upright. For an animal with fur, this would trap\\nair and provide greater insulation. Because people do\\nnot have thick fur, all this does for us is give us “goose\\nbumps.”\\nNail Follicles\\nFound on the ends of ﬁngers and toes, nail follicles\\nproduce nails just as hair follicles produce hair. Mitosis\\ntakes place in the nail root at the base of the nail (Fig.\\n5–4), and the new cells produce keratin (a stronger\\nform of this protein than is found in hair) and then die.\\nAlthough the nail itself consists of keratinized dead\\ncells, the ﬂat nail bed is living epidermis and dermis.\\nThis is why cutting a nail too short can be quite\\npainful. Nails protect the ends of the ﬁngers and toes\\nfrom mechanical injury and give the ﬁngers greater\\nability to pick up small objects. Fingernails are also\\ngood for scratching. This is more important than it\\nmay seem at ﬁrst. An itch might mean the presence of\\nan arthropod parasite, mosquito, tick, ﬂea, or louse.\\nThese parasites (all but the tick are insects) feed on\\nblood, and all are potential vectors of diseases caused\\nby bacteria, viruses, or protozoa. A quick and vigorous\\nscratch may kill or at least dislodge the arthropod and\\nprevent the transmission of the disease. Fingernails\\ngrow at the rate of about 0.12 in./month (3 mm), and\\ngrowth is a little faster during the summer months.\\nReceptors\\nMost sensory receptors for the cutaneous senses\\nare found in the dermis (Merkel cells are in the stra-\\ntum germinativum, as are some nerve endings). The\\ncutaneous senses are touch, pressure, heat, cold, and\\npain. For each sensation there is a speciﬁc type of\\nreceptor, which is a structure that will detect a partic-\\nular change. For pain, heat, and cold, the receptors are\\nfree nerve endings . For touch and pressure, the\\nreceptors are called encapsulated nerve endings ,\\nwhich means there is a cellular structure around the\\nsensory nerve ending (see Fig. 5–1). The purpose of\\nthese receptors and sensations is to provide the central\\nnervous system with information about the external\\nenvironment and its effect on the skin. This informa-\\ntion may stimulate responses, such as washing a\\npainful cut finger, scratching an insect bite, or\\nresponding to a feeling of cold by putting on a sweater.\\nThe sensitivity of an area of skin is determined by\\nhow many receptors are present. The skin of the ﬁn-\\ngertips, for example, is very sensitive to touch because\\nthere are many receptors per square inch. The skin of\\nthe upper arm, with few touch receptors per square\\ninch, is less sensitive.\\nWhen receptors detect changes, they generate\\nnerve impulses that are carried to the brain, which\\ninterprets the impulses as a particular sensation.\\nSensation, therefore, is actually a function of the brain\\n(we will return to this in Chapters 8 and 9).\\nGlands\\nGlands are made of epithelial tissue. The exocrine\\nglands of the skin have their secretory portions in the\\ndermis. Some of these are shown in Fig. 5–1.\\nSebaceous Glands. The ducts of sebaceous glands\\nopen into hair follicles or directly to the skin surface.\\nTheir secretion is sebum, a lipid substance that we\\ncommonly refer to as oil. As mentioned previously,\\nsebum inhibits the growth of bacteria on the skin sur-\\nface. Another function of sebum is to prevent drying of\\nskin and hair. The importance of this may not be read-\\nily apparent, but skin that is dry tends to crack more\\neasily. Even very small breaks in the skin are potential\\nentryways for bacteria. Decreased sebum production is\\nanother consequence of getting older, and elderly peo-\\nple often have dry and more fragile skin.\\nAdolescents may have the problem of overactive\\nsebaceous glands.

There are two types of sweat glands,\\napocrine and eccrine. Apocrine glands are most\\nnumerous in the axillae (underarm) and genital areas\\nand are most active in stressful and emotional situa-\\ntions. Although their secretion does have an odor, it is\\nbarely perceptible to other people. Animals such as\\ndogs, however, can easily distinguish among people\\nbecause of their individual scents. If the apocrine\\nsecretions are allowed to accumulate on the skin, bac-\\nteria metabolize the chemicals in the sweat and pro-\\nduce waste products that have distinct odors that\\nmany people ﬁnd unpleasant.\\nEccrine glands are found all over the body but are\\nespecially numerous on the forehead, upper lip, palms,\\nand soles. The secretory portion of these glands is\\nsimply a coiled tube in the dermis. The duct of this\\ntube extends to the skin’s surface, where it opens into\\na pore.\\nThe sweat produced by eccrine glands is important\\nin the maintenance of normal body temperature. In a\\nwarm environment, or during exercise, more sweat is\\nsecreted onto the skin surface, where it is then evapo-\\nrated by excess body heat. Recall that water has a high\\nheat of vaporization, which means that a great deal of\\nheat can be lost in the evaporation of a relatively small\\namount of water. Although this is a very effective\\nmechanism of heat loss, it has a potentially serious dis-\\nadvantage. Loss of too much body water in sweat may\\nlead to dehydration, as in heat exhaustion or even\\nafter exercise on a hot and humid day. Increased\\nsweating during exercise or on warm days should\\nalways be accompanied by increased ﬂuid intake.\\nThose who exercise regularly know that they must\\nreplace salt as well as water. Sodium chloride is also\\nlost in sweat, as are small amounts of urea (a nitroge-\\nnous waste product of amino acid metabolism). This\\nexcretory function of the skin is very minor, however;\\nthe kidneys are primarily responsible for removing\\nwaste products from the blood and for maintaining\\nthe body’s proper salt-to-water proportion.\\nBlood Vessels\\nBesides the capillaries in the dermis, the other blood\\nvessels of great importance are the arterioles.\\nArterioles are small arteries, and the smooth muscle\\nin their walls permits them to constrict (close) or\\ndilate (open). This is important in the maintenance of\\nbody temperature, because blood carries heat, which is\\na form of energy.\\nIn a warm environment the arterioles dilate\\n(vasodilation), which increases blood ﬂow through the\\ndermis and brings excess heat close to the body surface\\nto be radiated to the environment. In a cold environ-\\nment, however, body heat must be conserved if possi-\\nble, so the arterioles constrict. The vasoconstriction\\ndecreases the ﬂow of blood through the dermis and\\nkeeps heat within the core of the body. This adjusting\\nmechanism is essential for maintaining homeostasis.\\nRegulation of the diameter of the arterioles in\\nresponse to external temperature changes is controlled\\nby the nervous system. These changes can often be\\nseen in light-skinned people. Flushing, especially in\\nthe face, may be observed in hot weather. In cold, the\\nskin of the extremities may become even paler as blood\\nﬂow through the dermis decreases. In people with dark\\nskin, such changes are not as readily apparent because\\nthey are masked by melanin in the epidermis.\\nVasoconstriction in the dermis may also occur dur-\\ning stressful situations. For our ancestors, stress usu-\\nally demanded a physical response: Either stand and\\nﬁght or run away to safety. This is called the “ﬁght or\\nﬂight response.” Our nervous systems are still pro-\\ngrammed to respond as if physical activity were neces-\\nsary to cope with the stress situation. Vasoconstriction\\nin the dermis will shunt, or redirect, blood to more\\nvital organs such as the muscles, heart, and brain. In\\ntimes of stress, the skin is a relatively unimportant\\norgan and can function temporarily with a minimal\\nblood ﬂow. Y ou have probably heard the expression\\n“broke out in a cold sweat,” and may even have felt it\\nin a stressful situation. Such sweating feels cold\\nbecause vasoconstriction in the dermis makes the skin\\nrelatively cool.\\nBlood ﬂow in the dermis may be interrupted by\\nprolonged pressure on the skin. For example, a hospi-\\ntal patient who cannot turn over by herself may\\ndevelop a decubitus ulcer, also called a pressure ulcer\\nor pressure sore. The skin is compressed between the\\nobject outside, such as a bed, and a bony prominence\\nwithin, such as the heel bone or the sacrum in the\\nlower back. Without its blood supply the skin dies,\\nand the dead tissue is a potential site for bacterial\\ninfection.\\nThe functions of dermal structures are summarized\\nin T able 5–2.\\n98 The Integumentary System\\n05Scanlon(p3)-ch05  8/17/06  10:44 AM  Page 98'),\n",

Made of areolar connective tissue and adipose\\ntissue, the superﬁcial fascia connects the dermis to the\\nunderlying muscles. Its other functions are those of its\\ntissues, as you may recall from Chapter 4.\\nAreolar connective tissue, or loose connective tis-\\nsue, contains collagen and elastin ﬁbers and many\\nwhite blood cells that have left capillaries to wander\\naround in the tissue ﬂuid between skin and muscles.\\nThese migrating white blood cells destroy pathogens\\nthat enter the body through breaks in the skin. Mast\\ncells are specialized connective tissue cells found in\\nareolar tissue; they produce histamine, leukotrienes,\\nand other chemicals that help bring about inﬂamma-\\ntion, the body’s response to damage (inﬂammation is\\ndescribed in Chapters 10 and 14).\\nThe cells (adipocytes) of adipose tissue are special-\\nized to store fat, and our subcutaneous layer of fat\\nstores excess nutrients as a potential energy source.\\nThis layer also cushions bony prominences, such as\\nwhen sitting, and provides some insulation from cold.\\nFor people, this last function is relatively minor,\\nbecause we do not have a thick layer of fat, as do ani-\\nmals such as whales and seals. As mentioned in\\nChapter 4, adipose tissue is involved in the onset or\\ncessation of eating and in the use of insulin by body\\ncells, and it contributes to inﬂammation by produc-\\ning cytokines, chemicals that activate white blood\\ncells.\\nJust as the epidermis forms a continuous sheet that\\ncovers the body, the subcutaneous tissue is a continu-\\nous layer, though it is internal. If we consider the epi-\\ndermis as the ﬁrst line of defense against pathogens,\\nwe can consider the subcutaneous tissue a secondary\\nline of defense. There is, however, a signiﬁcant\\nanatomic difference. The cells of the epidermis are\\nvery closely and tightly packed, but the cells and\\nprotein ﬁbers of subcutaneous tissue are farther apart,\\nand there is much more tissue ﬂuid. If we imagine the\\nepidermis as a four-lane highway during rush hour\\nwith bumper-to-bumper traffic, the superﬁcial fascia\\nwould be that same highway at three o’clock in the\\nmorning, when it is not crowded and cars can move\\nmuch faster.

Necrotizing means “to cause\\ndeath,” and fasciitis is the inﬂammation of a fascia, in\\nthis case the superﬁcial fascia and the deep fasciae\\naround muscles. Necrotizing fasciitis is an extremely\\nserious infection and requires surgical removal of the\\ninfected tissue, or even amputation of an infected\\nlimb, to try to stop the spread of the bacteria.

The subcutaneous tissue is a second-\\nary line of defense against pathogens, a site of fat\\nstorage and of the other metabolic functions of adi-\\npose tissue.\\nThe Integumentary System 101\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nThe integumentary system consists of the\\nskin and its accessory structures and the\\nsubcutaneous tissue. The two major layers of\\nthe skin are the outer epidermis and the\\ninner dermis.\\nEpidermis—made of stratified squamous\\nepithelium; no capillaries; cells called ker-\\natinocytes (see Figs. 5–1 and 5–2 and Table\\n5–1)\\n1. Stratum germinativum—the innermost layer\\nwhere mitosis takes place; new cells produce ker-\\natin and die as they are pushed toward the surface.\\nDefensins are antimicrobial peptides produced\\nwhen the skin is injured. Vitamin D is formed from\\ncholesterol on exposure to the UV rays of sunlight.\\n2. Stratum corneum—the outermost layers of dead\\ncells; keratin prevents loss and entry of water and\\nresists entry of pathogens and chemicals.\\n3. Langerhans cells—phagocytize foreign material,\\ntake it to lymph nodes, and stimulate an immune\\nresponse by lymphocytes.\\n4. Melanocytes—in the lower epidermis, produce\\nmelanin. UV rays stimulate melanin production;\\nmelanin prevents further exposure of the stratum\\ngerminativum to UV rays by darkening the\\nskin.\\nDermis—made of irregular ﬁbrous connec-\\ntive tissue; collagen provides strength, and\\nelastin provides elasticity; capillaries in the\\npapillary layer nourish the stratum germina-\\ntivum (see Fig. 5–1 and Table 5–2)\\n1. Hair follicles—mitosis takes place in the hair root;\\nnew cells produce keratin, die, and become the hair\\nshaft. Hair of the scalp provides insulation from\\ncold for the head; eyelashes keep dust out of eyes;\\nnostril hairs keep dust out of nasal cavities (see\\nFigs. 5–1 and 5–3).\\n2. Nail follicles—at the ends of ﬁngers and toes; mito-\\nsis takes place in the nail root; the nail itself is dead,\\nkeratinized cells. Nails protect the ends of the ﬁn-\\ngers and toes, enable the ﬁngers to pick up small\\nobjects, and provide for efficient scratching (see\\nFig. 5–4).\\n3. Receptors—detect changes in the skin: touch, pres-\\nsure, heat, cold, and pain; provide information\\nabout the external environment that initiates appro-\\npriate responses; sensitivity of the skin depends on\\nthe number of receptors present.\\n4. Sebaceous glands—secrete sebum into hair follicles\\nor to the skin surface; sebum inhibits the growth of\\nbacteria and prevents drying of skin and hair.\\n5. Ceruminous glands—secrete cerumen in the ear\\ncanals; cerumen prevents drying of the eardrum.\\n05Scanlon(p3)-ch05  8/17/06  10:44 AM  Page 101'),\n",

What comes to mind? Probably that each of\\nus would be a little heap on the ﬂoor, much like a jel-\\nlyﬁsh out of water. Such an image is accurate and\\nreﬂects the most obvious function of the skeleton: to\\nsupport the body. Although it is a framework for the\\nbody, the skeleton is not at all like the wooden beams\\nthat support a house. Bones are living organs that\\nactively contribute to the maintenance of the internal\\nenvironment of the body.\\nThe skeletal system consists of bones and other\\nstructures that make up the joints of the skeleton. The\\ntypes of tissue present are bone tissue, cartilage, and\\nﬁbrous connective tissue, which forms the ligaments\\nthat connect bone to bone.\\nFUNCTIONS OF THE SKELETON\\n1. Provides a framework that supports the body; the\\nmuscles that are attached to bones move the skele-\\nton.\\n2. Protects some internal organs from mechanical\\ninjury; the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, for\\nexample.\\n3. Contains and protects the red bone marrow, the\\nprimary hemopoietic (blood-forming) tissue.\\n4. Provides a storage site for excess calcium. Calcium\\nmay be removed from bone to maintain a normal\\nblood calcium level, which is essential for blood\\nclotting and proper functioning of muscles and\\nnerves.\\nTYPES OF BONE TISSUE\\nBone was described as a tissue in Chapter 4. Recall\\nthat bone cells are called osteocytes, and the matrix\\nof bone is made of calcium salts and collagen. The\\ncalcium salts are calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and cal-\\ncium phosphate (Ca 3(PO4)2), which give bone the\\nstrength required to perform its supportive and pro-\\ntective functions. Bone matrix is non-living, but it\\nchanges constantly, with calcium that is taken from\\nbone into the blood replaced by calcium from the diet.\\nIn normal circumstances, the amount of calcium that\\nis removed is replaced by an equal amount of calcium\\ndeposited. This is the function of osteocytes, to regu-\\nlate the amount of calcium that is deposited in, or\\nremoved from, the bone matrix.\\nIn bone as an organ, two types of bone tissue are\\npresent (Fig. 6–1). Compact bone looks solid but is\\nvery precisely structured. Compact bone is made of\\nosteons or haversian systems, microscopic cylinders\\nof bone matrix with osteocytes in concentric rings\\naround central haversian canals . In the haversian\\ncanals are blood vessels; the osteocytes are in contact\\nwith these blood vessels and with one another through\\nmicroscopic channels (canaliculi) in the matrix.\\nThe second type of bone tissue is spongy bone ,\\nwhich does look rather like a sponge with its visible\\nholes or cavities. Osteocytes, matrix, and blood vessels\\nare present but are not arranged in haversian systems.\\nThe cavities in spongy bone often contain red bone\\nmarrow, which produces red blood cells, platelets,\\nand the ﬁve kinds of white blood cells.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF BONES\\n1. Long bones—the bones of the arms, legs, hands,\\nand feet (but not the wrists and ankles). The shaft\\nof a long bone is the diaphysis, and the ends are\\ncalled epiphyses (see Fig. 6–1). The diaphysis is\\nmade of compact bone and is hollow, forming a\\ncanal within the shaft. This marrow canal (or\\nmedullary cavity) contains yellow bone marrow ,\\nwhich is mostly adipose tissue. The epiphyses are\\nmade of spongy bone covered with a thin layer of\\ncompact bone. Although red bone marrow is pres-\\nent in the epiphyses of children’s bones, it is largely\\nreplaced by yellow bone marrow in adult bones.\\n2. Short bones—the bones of the wrists and ankles.\\n3. Flat bones—the ribs, shoulder blades, hip bones,\\nand cranial bones.\\n4. Irregular bones—the vertebrae and facial bones.\\nShort, ﬂat, and irregular bones are all made of\\nspongy bone covered with a thin layer of compact\\nbone. Red bone marrow is found within the spongy\\nbone.\\nThe joint surfaces of bones are covered with artic-\\nular cartilage, which provides a smooth surface. Cov-\\nering the rest of the bone is the periosteum, a ﬁbrous\\nconnective tissue membrane whose collagen ﬁbers\\nmerge with those of the tendons and ligaments that\\n106 The Skeletal System\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 106'),\n",

The periosteum anchors\\nthese structures and contains both the blood vessels\\nthat enter the bone itself and osteoblasts that will\\nbecome active if the bone is damaged.\\nEMBRYONIC GROWTH OF BONE\\nDuring embryonic development, the skeleton is ﬁrst\\nmade of cartilage and ﬁbrous connective tissue, which\\nare gradually replaced by bone. Bone matrix is pro-\\nduced by cells called osteoblasts (a blast cell is a “grow-\\ning” or “producing” cell, and osteo means “bone”). In\\nthe embryonic model of the skeleton, osteoblasts dif-\\nferentiate from the ﬁbroblasts that are present. The\\nproduction of bone matrix, called ossiﬁcation, begins\\nin a center of ossiﬁcation in each bone.\\nThe cranial and facial bones are ﬁrst made of\\nﬁbrous connective tissue. In the third month of fetal\\ndevelopment, ﬁbroblasts (spindle-shaped connective\\ntissue cells) become more specialized and differentiate\\ninto osteoblasts, which produce bone matrix. From\\neach center of ossiﬁcation, bone growth radiates out-\\nward as calcium salts are deposited in the collagen of\\nthe model of the bone. This process is not complete\\nat birth; a baby has areas of ﬁbrous connective tissue\\nremaining between the bones of the skull. These\\nare called fontanels (Fig. 6–2), which permit com-\\npression of the baby’s head during birth without\\nbreaking the still thin cranial bones. The fontanels\\nalso permit the growth of the brain after birth. Y ou\\nmay have heard fontanels referred to as “soft spots,”\\nand indeed they are. A baby’s skull is quite fragile and\\nmust be protected from trauma. By the age of 2 years,\\nall the fontanels have become ossiﬁed, and the skull\\nbecomes a more effective protective covering for the\\nbrain.\\nThe rest of the embryonic skeleton is ﬁrst made of\\ncartilage, and ossiﬁcation begins in the third month of\\ngestation in the long bones. Osteoblasts produce bone\\nmatrix in the center of the diaphyses of the long bones\\nand in the center of short, ﬂat, and irregular bones.\\nBone matrix gradually replaces the original cartilage\\n(Fig. 6–3).\\nThe long bones also develop centers of ossiﬁcation\\nin their epiphyses. At birth, ossiﬁcation is not yet com-\\nplete and continues throughout childhood. In long\\nbones, growth occurs in the epiphyseal discs at the\\njunction of the diaphysis with each epiphysis. An epi-\\nphyseal disc is still cartilage, and the bone grows in\\nlength as more cartilage is produced on the epiphysis\\nside (see Fig. 6–3). On the diaphysis side, osteoblasts\\nproduce bone matrix to replace the cartilage. Between\\nthe ages of 16 and 25 years (inﬂuenced by estrogen or\\ntestosterone), all of the cartilage of the epiphyseal\\ndiscs is replaced by bone. This is called closure of the\\nepiphyseal discs (or we say the discs are closed), and\\nthe bone lengthening process stops.\\nAlso in bones are specialized cells called osteo-\\nclasts (a clast cell is a “destroying” cell), which are able\\nto dissolve and reabsorb the minerals of bone matrix,\\na process called resorption. Osteoclasts are very\\nactive in embryonic long bones, and they reabsorb\\nbone matrix in the center of the diaphysis to form the\\nmarrow canal . Blood vessels grow into the marrow\\ncanals of embryonic long bones, and red bone marrow\\nis established. After birth, the red bone marrow is\\nreplaced by yellow bone marrow. Red bone marrow\\nremains in the spongy bone of short, ﬂat, and irregu-\\nlar bones. For other functions of osteoclasts and\\nosteoblasts, see Box 6–1: Fractures and Their Repair.\\nFACTORS THAT AFFECT BONE\\nGROWTH AND MAINTENANCE\\n1. Heredity—each person has a genetic potential for\\nheight, that is, a maximum height, with genes\\ninherited from both parents. Many genes are\\ninvolved, and their interactions are not well under-\\nstood. Some of these genes are probably those for\\nthe enzymes involved in cartilage and bone pro-\\nduction, for this is how bones grow.\\n2. Nutrition—nutrients are the raw materials of\\nwhich bones are made. Calcium, phosphorus, and\\nprotein become part of the bone matrix itself.\\nVitamin D is needed for the efficient absorption of\\ncalcium and phosphorus by the small intestine.\\nVitamins A and C do not become part of bone but\\nare necessary for the process of bone matrix forma-\\ntion (ossiﬁcation). Without these and other nutri-\\nents, bones cannot grow properly. Children who\\nare malnourished grow very slowly and may not\\nreach their genetic potential for height.\\n3. Hormones—endocrine glands produce hormones\\nthat stimulate speciﬁc effects in certain cells.\\n108 The Skeletal System\\n(text continued on page 112)\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 108'),\n",

Several types of\\nfractures are depicted in the right arm.\\nA fracture means that a bone has been broken.\\nThere are different types of fractures classiﬁed as to\\nextent of damage.\\nSimple (closed)—the broken parts are still in nor-\\nmal anatomic position; surrounding tissue damage\\nis minimal (skin is not pierced).\\nCompound (open) —the broken end of a bone\\nhas been moved, and it pierces the skin; there may\\nbe extensive damage to surrounding blood vessels,\\nnerves, and muscles.\\nGreenstick—the bone splits longitudinally. The\\nbones of children contain more collagen than do\\nadult bones and tend to splinter rather than break\\ncompletely.\\nComminuted—two or more intersecting breaks\\ncreate several bone fragments.\\nImpacted—the broken ends of a bone are forced\\ninto one another; many bone fragments may be\\ncreated.\\nPathologic (spontaneous)—a bone breaks with-\\nout apparent trauma; may accompany bone disor-\\nders such as osteoporosis.\\nThe Repair Process\\nEven a simple fracture involves signiﬁcant bone\\ndamage that must be repaired if the bone is to\\nresume its normal function. Fragments of dead or\\ndamaged bone must ﬁrst be removed. This is\\naccomplished by osteoclasts, which dissolve and\\nreabsorb the calcium salts of bone matrix. Imagine\\na building that has just collapsed; the rubble must\\nbe removed before reconstruction can take place.\\nThis is what the osteoclasts do. Then, new bone\\nmust be produced. The inner layer of the perios-\\nteum contains osteoblasts that are activated when\\nbone is damaged. The osteoblasts produce bone\\nmatrix to knit the broken ends of the bone\\ntogether.\\nBecause most bone has a good blood supply, the\\nrepair process is usually relatively rapid, and a sim-\\nple fracture often heals within 6 weeks. Some parts\\nof bones, however, have a poor blood supply, and\\nrepair of fractures takes longer. These areas are the\\nneck of the femur (the site of a “fractured hip”) and\\nthe lower third of the tibia.\\nOther factors that inﬂuence repair include the\\nage of the person, general state of health, and\\nnutrition. The elderly and those in poor health often\\nhave slow healing of fractures. A diet with sufficient\\ncalcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein is also\\nimportant. If any of these nutrients is lacking, bone\\nrepair will be a slower process.\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 111'),\n",

Exercise or “stress”—for bones, exercise means\\nbearing weight, which is just what bones are spe-\\ncialized to do. Without this stress (which is nor-\\nmal), bones will lose calcium faster than it is\\nreplaced.

Bones that do not get this exercise, such as\\nthose of patients conﬁned to bed, will become thin-\\nner and more fragile. This condition is discussed\\nfurther in Box 6–2: Osteoporosis.\\nTHE SKELETON\\nThe human skeleton has two divisions: the axial skele-\\nton, which forms the axis of the body, and the appen-\\ndicular skeleton, which supports the appendages or\\nlimbs. The axial skeleton consists of the skull, vertebral\\ncolumn, and rib cage. The bones of the arms and\\nlegs and the shoulder and pelvic girdles make up the\\nappendicular skeleton. Many bones are connected to\\nother bones across joints by ligaments, which are\\nstrong cords or sheets of ﬁbrous connective tissue. The\\nimportance of ligaments becomes readily apparent\\nwhen a joint is sprained. A sprain is the stretching or\\neven tearing of the ligaments of a joint, and though the\\nbones are not broken, the joint is weak and unsteady.\\nWe do not often think of our ligaments, but they are\\nnecessary to keep our bones in the proper positions to\\nkeep us upright or to bear weight.\\nThere are 206 bones in total, and the complete\\nskeleton is shown in Fig. 6–4.\\nSKULL\\nThe skull consists of 8 cranial bones and 14 facial\\nbones. Also in the head are three small bones in each\\nmiddle ear cavity and the hyoid bone that supports the\\nbase of the tongue. The cranial bones form the brain-\\ncase (lined with the meninges) that encloses and pro-\\ntects the brain, eyes, and ears. The names of some of\\nthese bones will be familiar to you; they are the same\\nas the terminology used (see Chapter 1) to describe\\nareas of the head. These are the frontal bone, parietal\\nbones (two), temporal bones (two), and occipital bone.\\nThe sphenoid bone and ethmoid bone are part of the\\nﬂoor of the braincase and the orbits (sockets) for\\nthe eyes. The frontal bone forms the forehead and\\nthe anterior part of the top of the skull. Parietal means\\n“wall,” and the two large parietal bones form the pos-\\nterior top and much of the side walls of the skull. Each\\ntemporal bone on the side of the skull contains an\\nexternal auditory meatus (ear canal), a middle ear cav-\\n112 The Skeletal System\\nTable 6–1 HORMONES INVOLVED IN BONE GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE\\nGrowth hormone (anterior pituitary gland)\\nThyroxine (thyroid gland)\\nInsulin (pancreas)\\nParathyroid hormone (parathyroid glands)\\nCalcitonin (thyroid gland)\\nEstrogen (ovaries) or\\nTestosterone (testes)\\n• Increases the rate of mitosis of chondrocytes and osteoblasts\\n• Increases the rate of protein synthesis (collagen, cartilage matrix,\\nand enzymes for cartilage and bone formation)\\n• Increases the rate of protein synthesis\\n• Increases energy production from all food types\\n• Increases energy production from glucose\\n• Increases the reabsorption of calcium from bones to the blood\\n(raises blood calcium level)\\n• Increases the absorption of calcium by the small intestine and kid-\\nneys (to the blood)\\n• Decreases the reabsorption of calcium from bones (lowers blood\\ncalcium level)\\n• Promotes closure of the epiphyses of long bones (growth stops)\\n• Helps retain calcium in bones to maintain a strong bone matrix\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 112'),\n",

The occipital bone\\nforms the lower, posterior part of the braincase. Its\\nforamen magnum is a large opening for the spinal\\ncord, and the two condyles (rounded projections) on\\neither side articulate with the atlas, the ﬁrst cervical\\nvertebra. The sphenoid bone is said to be shaped like\\na bat, and the greater wing is visible on the side of the\\nskull between the frontal and temporal bones. The\\nbody of the bat has a depression called the sella tur-\\ncica, which encloses the pituitary gland. The ethmoid\\nbone has a vertical projection called the crista galli\\n(“rooster’s comb”) that anchors the cranial meninges.\\nThe rest of the ethmoid bone forms the roof and\\nupper walls of the nasal cavities, and the upper part of\\nthe nasal septum.\\nAll of the joints between cranial bones are immov-\\nable joints called sutures.

( B) Spongy bone thinned\\nby osteoporosis.\\nBone is an active tissue; calcium is constantly being\\nremoved to maintain normal blood calcium levels.\\nUsually, however, calcium is replaced in bones at a\\nrate equal to its removal, and the bone matrix\\nremains strong.\\nOsteoporosis is characterized by excessive loss\\nof calcium from bones without sufficient replace-\\nment. Research has suggested that a certain gene\\nfor bone buildup in youth is an important factor;\\nless buildup would mean earlier bone thinning.\\nContributing environmental factors include smok-\\ning, insufficient dietary intake of calcium, inactivity,\\nand lack of the sex hormones. Osteoporosis is most\\ncommon among elderly women, because estrogen\\nsecretion decreases sharply at menopause (in older\\nmen, testosterone is still secreted in signiﬁcant\\namounts). Factors such as bed rest or inability to\\nget even minimal exercise will make calcium loss\\neven more rapid.\\nAs bones lose calcium and become thin and brit-\\ntle, fractures are much more likely to occur. Among\\nelderly women, a fractured hip (the neck of the\\nfemur) is an all-too-common consequence of this\\ndegenerative bone disorder. Such a serious injury is\\nnot inevitable, however, and neither is the thinning\\nof the vertebrae that bows the spines of some eld-\\nerly people. After menopause, women may wish to\\nhave a bone density test to determine the strength\\nof their bone matrix. Several medications are avail-\\nable that diminish the rate of bone loss. A diet high\\nin calcium and vitamin D is essential for both men\\nand women, as is moderate exercise. Young women\\nand teenagers should make sure they get adequate\\ndietary calcium to form strong bone matrix,\\nbecause this will delay the serious effects of osteo-\\nporosis later in life.\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 113'),\n",

Keep in mind,\\nthough, that the rib cage also protects organs in the\\nupper abdominal cavity, such as the liver and spleen.\\nThe other important function of the rib cage depends\\nupon its ﬂexibility: The ribs are pulled upward and\\noutward by the external intercostal muscles. This\\nenlarges the chest cavity, which expands the lungs and\\ncontributes to inhalation.\\nTHE SHOULDER AND ARM\\nThe shoulder girdles attach the arms to the axial skele-\\nton. Each consists of a scapula (shoulder blade) and\\nclavicle (collarbone). The scapula is a large, ﬂat bone\\nwith several projections (the spine of the scapula, the\\ncoracoid process) that anchor some of the muscles that\\nmove the upper arm and the forearm. A shallow\\ndepression called the glenoid fossa forms a ball-and-\\nsocket joint with the humerus, the bone of the upper\\narm (Fig. 6–12).\\nEach clavicle articulates laterally with a scapula\\nand medially with the manubrium of the sternum. In\\nthis position the clavicles act as braces for the scapulae\\nand prevent the shoulders from coming too far for-\\nward. Although the shoulder joint is capable of a wide\\nrange of movement, the shoulder itself must be rela-\\ntively stable if these movements are to be effective.\\nThe humerus is the long bone of the upper arm. In\\nFig. 6–12, notice the deltoid tubercle (or tuberosity);\\nthe triangular deltoid muscle that caps the shoulder\\njoint is anchored here. Proximally, the humerus forms\\na ball-and-socket joint with the scapula. Distally, the\\nhumerus forms a hinge joint with the ulna of the\\nforearm. This hinge joint, the elbow, permits move-\\nment in one plane, that is, back and forth with no lat-\\neral movement.\\nThe forearm bones are the ulna on the little ﬁnger\\nside and the radius on the thumb side. The semilunar\\nnotch of the ulna is part of the hinge joint of the\\nelbow; it articulates with the trochlea of the humerus.\\nThe radius and ulna articulate proximally to form a\\npivot joint, which permits turning the hand palm up\\nto palm down. Y ou can demonstrate this yourself by\\nholding your arm palm up in front of you, and noting\\nthat the radius and ulna are parallel to each other.\\nThen turn your hand palm down, and notice that your\\n122 The Skeletal System\\nBOX 6–4 ABNORMALITIES OF THE\\nCURVES OF THE SPINE\\nScoliosis—an abnormal lateral curvature, which\\nmay be congenital, the result of having one leg\\nlonger than the other, or the result of chronic\\npoor posture during childhood while the verte-\\nbrae are still growing. Usually the thoracic verte-\\nbrae are affected, which displaces the rib cage to\\none side. In severe cases, the abdominal organs\\nmay be compressed, and the expansion of the\\nrib cage during inhalation may be impaired.\\nKyphosis*—an exaggerated thoracic curve;\\nsometimes referred to as hunchback.\\nLordosis *—an exaggerated lumbar curve;\\nsometimes referred to as swayback.\\nThese abnormal curves are usually the result\\nof degenerative bone diseases such as osteo-\\nporosis or tuberculosis of the spine. If osteoporo-\\nsis, for example, causes the bodies of the thoracic\\nvertebrae to collapse, the normal thoracic curve\\nwill be increased. Most often the vertebral body\\n“settles” slowly (rather than collapses suddenly)\\nand there is little, if any, damage to the spinal\\nnerves. The damage to the vertebrae, however,\\ncannot be easily corrected, so these conditions\\nshould be thought of in terms of prevention\\nrather than cure.\\n*Although descriptive of normal anatomy, the terms\\nkyphosis and lordosis, respectively, are commonly used to\\ndescribe the abnormal condition associated with each.\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 122'),\n",

The\\ntwo pubic bones articulate with one another at the\\npubic symphysis , with a disc of ﬁbrous cartilage\\nbetween them.

Because the\\nacetabulum is deep, the hip joint is not easily dislo-\\ncated, even by activities such as running and jumping\\n(landing), which put great stress on the joint.\\nThe femur is the long bone of the thigh. As men-\\ntioned, the femur forms a very movable ball-and-\\nsocket joint with the hip bone. At the proximal end of\\nthe femur are the greater and lesser trochanters, large\\nprojections that are anchors for muscles. At its distal\\nend, the femur forms a hinge joint, the knee, with the\\ntibia of the lower leg. Notice in Fig. 6–14 that each\\nbone has condyles, which are the rounded projections\\nthat actually form the joint. The patella, or kneecap,\\nis anterior to the knee joint, enclosed in the tendon of\\nthe quadriceps femoris, a large muscle group of the\\nthigh.\\nThe tibia is the weight-bearing bone of the lower\\nleg. Y ou can feel the tibial tuberosity (a bump) and\\nanterior crest (a ridge) on the front of your own leg.\\nThe medial malleolus, what we may call the “inner\\nankle bone,” is at the distal end. Notice in Fig. 6–14\\nthat the ﬁbula is not part of the knee joint and does\\nnot bear much weight. The lateral malleolus of the\\nﬁbula is the “outer ankle bone” you can ﬁnd just above\\nyour foot. Though not a weight-bearing bone, the\\nﬁbula is important in that leg muscles are attached and\\nanchored to it, and it helps stabilize the ankle. T wo\\nbones on one is a much more stable arrangement than\\none bone on one, and you can see that the malleoli of\\nthe tibia and ﬁbula overlap the sides of the talus. The\\ntibia and ﬁbula do not form a pivot joint as do the\\nradius and ulna in the forearm; this also contributes to\\nthe stability of the lower leg and foot and the support\\nof the entire body.\\nThe tarsals are the seven bones in the ankle. As\\nyou would expect, they are larger and stronger than\\nthe carpals of the wrist, and their gliding joints do not\\nprovide nearly as much movement. The largest is the\\ncalcaneus, or heel bone; the talus transmits weight\\nbetween the calcaneus and the tibia. Metatarsals are\\nthe ﬁve long bones of each foot, and phalanges are\\nthe bones of the toes. There are two phalanges in the\\nbig toe and three in each of the other toes. The pha-\\nlanges of the toes form hinge joints with each other.\\nBecause there is no saddle joint in the foot, the big toe\\nis not as movable as the thumb. The foot has two\\nmajor arches, longitudinal and transverse, that are\\nsupported by ligaments. These are adaptations for\\nwalking completely upright, in that arches provide for\\nspring or bounce in our steps.

A synarthrosis is an immovable\\njoint, such as a suture between two cranial bones.\\nAn amphiarthrosis is a slightly movable joint, such\\nas the symphysis joint between adjacent vertebrae. A\\ndiarthrosis is a freely movable joint. This is the largest\\ncategory of joints and includes the ball-and-socket\\njoint, the pivot, hinge, and others. Examples of each\\ntype of joint are described in T able 6–5, and many of\\nthese are illustrated in Fig. 6–15.\\nSYNOVIAL JOINTS\\nAll diarthroses, or freely movable joints, are synovial\\njoints because they share similarities of structure. A\\ntypical synovial joint is shown in Fig. 6–16. On the\\njoint surface of each bone is the articular cartilage,\\nwhich provides a smooth surface. The joint capsule,\\nmade of ﬁbrous connective tissue, encloses the joint in\\na strong sheath, like a sleeve. Lining the joint capsule\\nis the synovial membrane, which secretes synovial\\nﬂuid into the joint cavity. Synovial ﬂuid is thick and\\nslippery and prevents friction as the bones move.\\nMany synovial joints also have bursae (or bursas),\\nwhich are small sacs of synovial ﬂuid between the joint\\nand the tendons that cross over the joint. Bursae per-\\nmit the tendons to slide easily as the bones are moved.\\nIf a joint is used excessively, the bursae may become\\ninﬂamed and painful; this condition is called bursitis.\\nSome other disorders of joints are described in Box\\n6–5: Arthritis.\\nAGING AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM\\nWith age, bone tissue tends to lose more calcium than\\nis replaced. Bone matrix becomes thinner, the bones\\nthemselves more brittle, and fractures are more likely\\nto occur with mild trauma.\\nErosion of the articular cartilages of joints is also a\\ncommon consequence of aging. Joints affected include\\nweight-bearing joints such as the knees, and active,\\nsmall joints such as those of the ﬁngers.\\n(text continued on page 131)\\n06Scanlon(p3)-ch06  8/17/06  11:13 AM  Page 128'),\n",

The\\nautoimmune activity seems to affect the synovial\\nmembrane, and joints become painful and stiff.\\nSometimes the disease progresses to total destruc-\\ntion of the synovial membrane and calciﬁcation of\\nthe joint. Such a joint is then fused and has no\\nmobility at all. Autoimmune damage may also\\noccur in the heart and blood vessels, and those with\\nRA are more prone to heart attacks and strokes (RA\\nis a systemic, not a localized, disease).\\nTreatment of rheumatoid arthritis is directed at\\nreducing inﬂammation as much as possible, for it is\\nthe inﬂammatory process that causes the damage.\\nTherapies being investigated involve selectively\\nblocking speciﬁc aspects of the immune response,\\nsuch as antibody production. At present there is no\\ncure for autoimmune diseases.\\nThe term arthritis means “inﬂammation of a\\njoint.” Of the many types of arthritis, we will con-\\nsider two: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\\nOsteoarthritis is a natural consequence of get-\\nting older. In joints that have borne weight for\\nmany years, the articular cartilage is gradually worn\\naway. The once smooth joint surface becomes\\nrough, and the affected joint is stiff and painful.

It is important to remem-\\nber, however, that bones have other functions as well.\\nAs a storage site for excess calcium, bones contribute\\nto the maintenance of a normal blood calcium level.\\nThe red bone marrow found in ﬂat and irregular\\nbones produces the blood cells: red blood cells, white\\nblood cells, and platelets. Some bones protect vital\\norgans such as the brain, heart, and lungs. As you can\\nsee, bones themselves may also be considered vital\\norgans.\\nThe Skeletal System 131\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nThe skeleton is made of bone and cartilage\\nand has these functions:\\n1. Is a framework for support, connected by liga-\\nments, moved by muscles.\\n2. Protects internal organs from mechanical injury.\\n3. Contains and protects red bone marrow.\\n4. Stores excess calcium; important to regulate blood\\ncalcium level.\\nBone Tissue (see Fig. 6–1)\\n1. Osteocytes (cells) are found in the matrix of cal-\\ncium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and collagen.\\n2. Compact bone—haversian systems are present.\\n3. Spongy bone—no haversian systems; red bone\\nmarrow present.\\n4. Articular cartilage—smooth, on joint surfaces.\\n5. Periosteum—ﬁbrous connective tissue membrane;\\nanchors tendons and ligaments; has blood vessels\\nthat enter the bone.\\nClassiﬁcation of Bones\\n1. Long—arms, legs; shaft is the diaphysis (compact\\nbone) with a marrow cavity containing yellow bone\\nmarrow (fat); ends are epiphyses (spongy bone) (see\\nFig. 6–1).\\n2. Short—wrists, ankles (spongy bone covered with\\ncompact bone).\\n3. Flat—ribs, pelvic bone, cranial bones (spongy bone\\ncovered with compact bone).\\n4. Irregular—vertebrae, facial bones (spongy bone\\ncovered with compact bone).\\nEmbryonic Growth of Bone\\n1. The embryonic skeleton is ﬁrst made of other tis-\\nsues that are gradually replaced by bone. Ossiﬁca-\\ntion begins in the third month of gestation;\\nosteoblasts differentiate from ﬁbroblasts and pro-\\nduce bone matrix.\\n2. Cranial and facial bones are ﬁrst made of ﬁbrous\\nconnective tissue; osteoblasts produce bone matrix\\nin a center of ossiﬁcation in each bone; bone growth\\nradiates outward; fontanels remain at birth, permit\\ncompression of infant skull during birth; fontanels\\nare calciﬁed by age 2 (see Fig. 6–2).\\n3. All other bones are ﬁrst made of cartilage; in a long\\nbone the ﬁrst center of ossiﬁcation is in the diaph-\\nysis, other centers develop in the epiphyses.

Most of us do, or we may\\nsimply enjoy watching good dancers. The grace and\\ncoordination involved in dancing result from the\\ninteraction of many of the organ systems, but the one\\nyou think of ﬁrst is probably the muscular system.\\nThere are more than 600 muscles in the human\\nbody. Most of these muscles are attached to the bones\\nof the skeleton by tendons, although a few muscles\\nare attached to the undersurface of the skin. The pri-\\nmary function of the muscular system is to move\\nthe skeleton. The muscle contractions required for\\nmovement also produce heat, which contributes to the\\nmaintenance of a constant body temperature. The\\nother body systems directly involved in movement\\nare the nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems.\\nThe nervous system transmits the electrochemical\\nimpulses that cause muscle cells to contract. The res-\\npiratory system exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide\\nbetween the air and blood. The circulatory system\\nbrings oxygen to the muscles and takes carbon\\ndioxide away.\\nThese interactions of body systems are covered in\\nthis chapter, which focuses on the skeletal muscles.\\nY ou may recall from Chapter 4 that there are two\\nother types of muscle tissue: smooth muscle and car-\\ndiac muscle. These types of muscle tissue will be dis-\\ncussed in other chapters in relation to the organs of\\nwhich they are part. Before you continue, you may\\nﬁnd it helpful to go back to Chapter 4 and review the\\nstructure and characteristics of skeletal muscle tissue.\\nIn this chapter we will begin with the gross (large)\\nanatomy and physiology of muscles, then discuss the\\nmicroscopic structure of muscle cells and the bio-\\nchemistry of muscle contraction.\\nMUSCLE STRUCTURE\\nAll muscle cells are specialized for contraction. When\\nthese cells contract, they shorten and pull a bone to\\nproduce movement. Each skeletal muscle is made of\\nthousands of individual muscle cells, which also may\\nbe called muscle ﬁbers (see Fig. 7–3 later in this\\nchapter). Depending on the work a muscle is required\\nto do, variable numbers of muscle ﬁbers contract.\\nWhen picking up a pencil, for example, only a small\\nportion of the muscle ﬁbers in each ﬁnger muscle will\\ncontract. If the muscle has more work to do, such as\\npicking up a book, more muscle ﬁbers will contract to\\naccomplish the task.\\nMuscles are anchored ﬁrmly to bones by tendons.\\nMost tendons are rope-like, but some are ﬂat; a ﬂat\\ntendon is called an aponeurosis. (See Fig. 7–9 later in\\nthis chapter for the epicranial aponeurosis, but before\\nyou look, decide what epicranial means.) T endons are\\nmade of ﬁbrous connective tissue, which, you may\\nremember, is very strong and merges with the fascia\\nthat covers the muscle and with the periosteum, the\\nﬁbrous connective tissue membrane that covers bones.\\nA muscle usually has at least two tendons, each\\nattached to a different bone. The more immobile or\\nstationary attachment of the muscle is its origin; the\\nmore movable attachment is called the insertion. The\\nmuscle itself crosses the joint of the two bones to\\nwhich it is attached, and when the muscle contracts it\\npulls on its insertion and moves the bone in a speciﬁc\\ndirection.\\nMUSCLE ARRANGEMENTS\\nMuscles are arranged around the skeleton so as to\\nbring about a variety of movements. The two general\\ntypes of arrangements are the opposing antagonists\\nand the cooperative synergists.\\nAntagonistic Muscles\\nAntagonists are opponents, so we use the term antag-\\nonistic muscles for muscles that have opposing or\\nopposite functions. An example will be helpful here—\\nrefer to Fig. 7–1 as you read the following. The biceps\\nbrachii is the muscle on the front of the upper arm.\\nThe origin of the biceps is on the scapula (there are\\nactually two tendons, hence the name biceps), and the\\ninsertion is on the radius. When the biceps contracts,\\nit ﬂexes the forearm, that is, bends the elbow (see\\nT able 7–2 later in this chapter). Recall that when a\\nmuscle contracts, it gets shorter and pulls. Muscles\\ncannot push, for when they relax they exert no force.\\nTherefore, the biceps can bend the elbow but cannot\\nstraighten it; another muscle is needed. The triceps\\nbrachii is located on the back of the upper arm. Its ori-\\ngins (the preﬁx tri tells you that there are three of\\nthem) are on the scapula and humerus, and its inser-\\ntion is on the ulna. When the triceps contracts and\\npulls, it extends the forearm, that is, straightens the\\nelbow.\\n138 The Muscular System\\n07Scanlon(p3)-ch07  8/17/06  10:45 AM  Page 138'),\n",

Notice how many\\nways you can move your upper arm at the shoulder, for\\ninstance. Abducting (laterally raising) the arm is the\\nfunction of the deltoid. Adducting the arm is brought\\nabout by the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.\\nFlexion of the arm (across the chest) is also a function\\nof the pectoralis major, and extension of the arm\\n(behind the back) is also a function of the latissimus\\ndorsi. All of these muscles are described and depicted\\nin the tables and ﬁgures later in the chapter. Without\\nantagonistic muscles, this variety of movements would\\nnot be possible.\\nY ou may be familiar with range-of-motion (or\\nROM) exercises that are often recommended for\\npatients conﬁned to bed. Such exercises are designed\\nto stretch and contract the antagonistic muscles of a\\njoint to preserve as much muscle function and joint\\nmobility as possible.\\nSynergistic Muscles\\nSynergistic muscles are those with the same func-\\ntion, or those that work together to perform a partic-\\nular function. Recall that the biceps brachii ﬂexes the\\nforearm. The brachioradialis, with its origin on the\\nhumerus and insertion on the radius, also ﬂexes\\nthe forearm. There is even a third ﬂexor of the fore-\\narm, the brachialis. Y ou may wonder why we need\\nthree muscles to perform the same function, and the\\nexplanation lies in the great mobility of the hand. If\\nthe hand is palm up, the biceps does most of the work\\nof ﬂexing and may be called the prime mover. When\\nthe hand is thumb up, the brachioradialis is in position\\nto be the prime mover, and when the hand is palm\\ndown, the brachialis becomes the prime mover. If you\\nhave ever tried to do chin-ups, you know that it is\\nmuch easier with your palms toward you than with\\npalms away from you. This is because the biceps is a\\nlarger, and usually much stronger, muscle than is the\\nbrachialis.\\nMuscles may also be called synergists if they help to\\nstabilize or steady a joint to make a more precise\\nmovement possible. If you drink a glass of water, the\\nbiceps brachii may be the prime mover to ﬂex the\\nforearm. At the same time, the muscles of the shoul-\\nder keep that joint stable, so that the water gets to\\nyour mouth, not over your shoulder or down your\\nchin. The shoulder muscles are considered synergists\\nfor this movement because their contribution makes\\nthe movement effective.\\nTHE ROLE OF THE BRAIN\\nEven our simplest movements require the interaction\\nof many muscles, and the contraction of skeletal mus-\\ncles depends on the brain. The nerve impulses for\\nmovement come from the frontal lobes of the cere-\\nbrum. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain;\\nthe frontal lobes are beneath the frontal bone.

When walking, for exam-\\nple, antagonistic muscles on the front and back of the\\nthigh or the lower leg will alternate their contractions\\nand relaxations, and our steps will be smooth and effi-\\ncient. This is what we call coordination, and we do not\\nhave to think about making it happen. Coordination\\ntakes place below the level of conscious thought and is\\nregulated by the cerebellum, which is located below\\nthe occipital lobes of the cerebrum.\\nMUSCLE TONE\\nExcept during certain stages of sleep, most of our\\nmuscles are in a state of slight contraction; this is what\\nis known as muscle tone. When sitting upright, for\\nexample, the tone of your neck muscles keeps your\\nhead up, and the tone of your back muscles keeps your\\nback straight. This is an important function of muscle\\ntone for human beings, because it helps us to maintain\\nan upright posture. For a muscle to remain slightly\\ncontracted, only a few of the muscle ﬁbers in that\\nmuscle must contract. Alternate ﬁbers contract so that\\nthe muscle as a whole does not become fatigued. This\\nis similar to a pianist continuously rippling her ﬁngers\\nover the keys of the piano—some notes are always\\nsounding at any given moment, but the notes that are\\nsounding are always changing. This contraction of\\nalternate ﬁbers, muscle tone, is also regulated by the\\ncerebellum of the brain.\\nMuscle ﬁbers need the energy of ATP (adenosine\\ntriphosphate) in order to contract. When they pro-\\nduce ATP in the process of cell respiration, muscle\\nﬁbers also produce heat. The heat generated by nor-\\nmal muscle tone is approximately 25% of the total\\nbody heat at rest. During exercise, of course, heat pro-\\nduction increases signiﬁcantly.\\nEXERCISE\\nGood muscle tone improves coordination. When\\nmuscles are slightly contracted, they can react more\\nrapidly if and when greater exertion is necessary.\\nMuscles with poor tone are usually soft and ﬂabby, but\\nexercise will improve muscle tone.\\nThere are two general types of exercise: isotonic\\nand isometric. In isotonic exercise, muscles contract\\nand bring about movement. Jogging, swimming, and\\nweight lifting are examples. Isotonic exercise improves\\nmuscle tone, muscle strength, and, if done repetitively\\nagainst great resistance (as in weight lifting), muscle\\nsize. This type of exercise also improves cardiovascu-\\nlar and respiratory efficiency, because movement\\nexerts demands on the heart and respiratory muscles.\\nIf done for 30 minutes or longer, such exercise may be\\ncalled aerobic, because it strengthens the heart and res-\\npiratory muscles as well as the muscles attached to the\\nskeleton.\\nIsotonic contractions are of two kinds, concentric\\nor eccentric. A concentric contraction is the short-\\nening of a muscle as it exerts force. An eccentric\\ncontraction is the lengthening of a muscle as it still\\nexerts force. Imagine lifting a book straight up (or try\\nit); the triceps brachii contracts and shortens to\\nstraighten the elbow and raise the book, a concentric\\ncontraction. Now imagine slowly lowering the book.\\nThe triceps brachii is still contracting even as it is\\nlengthening, exerting force to oppose gravity (which\\nwould make the book drop quickly).

If you put your palms together and push\\none hand against the other, you can feel your arm\\nmuscles contracting. If both hands push equally, there\\nwill be no movement; this is isometric contraction.\\nSuch exercises will increase muscle tone and muscle\\nstrength but are not considered aerobic. When the\\nbody is moving, the brain receives sensory informa-\\ntion about this movement from the joints involved,\\nand responds with reﬂexes that increase heart rate and\\nrespiration.

Without such control\\n(which we do not have to think about) a downhill walk\\nwould quickly become a roll. These various kinds of\\ncontractions are needed for even the simplest activi-\\nties. (With respect to increasing muscle strength, see\\nBox 7–1: Anabolic Steroids.)\\nMUSCLE SENSE\\nWhen you walk up a ﬂight of stairs, do you have to\\nlook at your feet to be sure each will get to the next\\nstep? Most of us don’t (an occasional stumble doesn’t\\ncount), and for this freedom we can thank our\\nmuscle sense. Muscle sense (proprioception) is the\\nbrain’s ability to know where our muscles are and what\\nthey are doing, without our having to consciously\\nlook at them.\\nWithin muscles are receptors called stretch recep-\\ntors (proprioceptors or muscle spindles). The general\\nfunction of all sensory receptors is to detect changes.\\nThe function of stretch receptors is to detect changes\\nin the length of a muscle as it is stretched. The sen-\\nsory impulses generated by these receptors are inter-\\npreted by the brain as a mental “picture” of where the\\nmuscle is.\\nWe can be aware of muscle sense if we choose to be,\\nbut usually we can safely take it for granted. In fact,\\nthat is what we are meant to do. Imagine what life\\nwould be like if we had to watch every move to be sure\\nthat a hand or foot performed its intended action.\\nEven simple activities such as walking or eating would\\nrequire our constant attention.\\nAt times, we may become aware of our muscle\\nsense. Learning a skill such as typing or playing the\\nguitar involves very precise movements of the ﬁngers,\\nand beginners will often watch their ﬁngers to be sure\\nthey are moving properly. With practice, however,\\nthe movements simply “feel” right, which means that\\nthe brain has formed a very good mental picture of the\\ntask. Muscle sense again becomes unconscious, and\\nthe experienced typist or guitarist need not watch\\nevery movement.\\nAll sensation is a function of brain activity, and\\nmuscle sense is no exception. The impulses for muscle\\nsense are integrated in the parietal lobes of the cere-\\nbrum (conscious muscle sense) and in the cerebellum\\n(unconscious muscle sense) to be used to promote\\ncoordination.\\nENERGY SOURCES FOR\\nMUSCLE CONTRACTION\\nBefore discussing the contraction process itself, let us\\nlook ﬁrst at how muscle ﬁbers obtain the energy they\\nneed to contract. The direct source of energy for mus-\\ncle contraction is ATP . ATP , however, is not stored in\\nlarge amounts in muscle ﬁbers and is depleted in a few\\nseconds.\\nThe secondary energy sources are creatine phos-\\nphate and glycogen. Creatine phosphate is, like\\nATP , an energy-transferring molecule. When it is bro-\\nken down (by an enzyme) to creatine, phosphate, and\\nenergy, the energy is used to synthesize more ATP .\\nMost of the creatine formed is used to resynthesize\\ncreatine phosphate, but some is converted to creati-\\nnine, a nitrogenous waste product that is excreted by\\nthe kidneys.\\nThe most abundant energy source in muscle ﬁbers\\nThe Muscular System 141\\nBOX 7–1 ANABOLIC STEROIDS\\nwill increase muscle size, but there are hazards,\\nsome of them very serious. Side effects of such\\nself-medication include liver damage, kidney dam-\\nage, disruption of reproductive cycles, and\\nmental changes such as irritability and aggres-\\nsiveness.\\nFemale athletes may develop increased growth\\nof facial and body hair and may become sterile as a\\nresult of the effects of a male hormone on their own\\nhormonal cycles.\\nAnabolic steroids are synthetic drugs very similar\\nin structure and action to the male hormone testos-\\nterone. Normal secretion of testosterone, begin-\\nning in males at puberty, increases muscle size and\\nis the reason men usually have larger muscles than\\ndo women.\\nSome athletes, both male and female, both\\namateur and professional, take anabolic steroids to\\nbuild muscle mass and to increase muscle strength.\\nThere is no doubt that the use of anabolic steroids\\n07Scanlon(p3)-ch07  8/17/06  10:45 AM  Page 141'),\n",

When glycogen is needed to provide\\nenergy for sustained contractions (more than a few\\nseconds), it is ﬁrst broken down into the glucose mol-\\necules of which it is made. Glucose is then further bro-\\nken down in the process of cell respiration to produce\\nATP , and muscle ﬁbers may continue to contract.\\nRecall from Chapter 2 our simple reaction for cell\\nrespiration:\\nGlucose /H11001O\\n2 → CO2 /H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001heat\\nLook ﬁrst at the products of this reaction. ATP will\\nbe used by the muscle ﬁbers for contraction. The heat\\nproduced will contribute to body temperature, and if\\nexercise is strenuous, will increase body temperature.\\nThe water becomes part of intracellular water, and the\\ncarbon dioxide is a waste product that will be exhaled.\\nNow look at what is needed to release energy from\\nglucose: oxygen. Muscles have two sources of oxygen.\\nThe blood delivers a continuous supply of oxygen\\nfrom the lungs, which is carried by the hemoglobin in\\nred blood cells. Within muscle ﬁbers themselves there\\nis another protein called myoglobin, which stores\\nsome oxygen within the muscle cells. Both hemoglo-\\nbin and myoglobin contain the mineral iron, which\\nenables them to bond to oxygen. (Iron also makes\\nboth molecules red, and it is myoglobin that gives\\nmuscle tissue a red or dark color.)\\nDuring strenuous exercise, the oxygen stored in\\nmyoglobin is quickly used up, and normal circulation\\nmay not deliver oxygen fast enough to permit the\\ncompletion of cell respiration. Even though the respi-\\nratory rate increases, the muscle ﬁbers may literally\\nrun out of oxygen. This state is called oxygen debt,\\nand in this case, glucose cannot be completely broken\\ndown into carbon dioxide and water. If oxygen is not\\npresent (or not present in sufficient amounts), glucose\\nis converted to an intermediate molecule called lactic\\nacid, which causes muscle fatigue.\\nIn a state of fatigue, muscle ﬁbers cannot contract\\nefficiently, and contraction may become painful. T o be\\nin oxygen debt means that we owe the body some oxy-\\ngen. Lactic acid from muscles enters the blood and\\ncirculates to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvic\\nacid, a simple carbohydrate (three carbons, about\\nhalf a glucose molecule). This conversion requires\\nATP , and oxygen is needed to produce the necessary\\nATP in the liver. This is why, after strenuous exercise,\\nthe respiratory rate and heart rate remain high for a\\ntime and only gradually return to normal. Another\\nname proposed for this state is recovery oxygen\\nuptake, which is a little longer but also makes sense.\\nOxygen uptake means a faster and deeper respiratory\\nrate. What is this uptake for? For recovery from stren-\\nuous exercise.\\nMUSCLE FIBER—\\nMICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE\\nWe will now look more closely at a muscle ﬁber, keep-\\ning in mind that there are thousands of these cylindri-\\ncal cells in one muscle. Each muscle ﬁber has its own\\nmotor nerve ending; the neuromuscular junction is\\nwhere the motor neuron terminates on the muscle\\nﬁber (Fig. 7–2). The axon terminal is the enlarged tip\\nof the motor neuron; it contains sacs of the neuro-\\ntransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The membrane of\\nthe muscle ﬁber is the sarcolemma, which contains\\nreceptor sites for acetylcholine, and an inactivator\\ncalled cholinesterase. The synapse (or synaptic cleft)\\nis the small space between the axon terminal and the\\nsarcolemma.\\nWithin the muscle ﬁber are thousands of individual\\ncontracting units called sarcomeres , which are\\narranged end to end in cylinders called myoﬁbrils.\\nThe structure of a sarcomere is shown in Fig. 7–3:\\nThe Z lines are the end boundaries of a sarcomere.\\nFilaments of the protein myosin are in the center of\\nthe sarcomere, and ﬁlaments of the protein actin are\\nat the ends, attached to the Z lines. Myosin ﬁlaments\\nare anchored to the Z lines by the protein titin.\\nMyosin and actin are the contractile proteins of a\\nmuscle ﬁber. Their interactions produce muscle con-\\ntraction. Also present are two inhibitory proteins, tro-\\nponin and tropomyosin, which are part of the actin\\nﬁlaments and prevent the sliding of actin and myosin\\nwhen the muscle ﬁber is relaxed.\\nSurrounding the sarcomeres is the sarcoplasmic\\nreticulum, the endoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells.\\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum is a reservoir for calcium\\nions (Ca\\n/H110012), which are essential for the contraction\\nprocess.\\nAll of these parts of a muscle ﬁber are involved in\\nthe contraction process. Contraction begins when a\\nnerve impulse arrives at the axon terminal and stimu-\\nlates the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine gener-\\nates electrical changes (the movement of ions) at the\\nsarcolemma of the muscle ﬁber. These electrical\\nchanges initiate a sequence of events within the mus-\\ncle ﬁber that is called the sliding ﬁlament mecha-\\nnism of muscle contraction.

If this action of cholinesterase is inhibited,\\nacetylcholine remains on the sarcolemma for a\\nlonger time and may bond to any remaining recep-\\ntors to stimulate depolarization and contraction.\\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder\\ncharacterized by extreme muscle fatigue even after\\nminimal exertion. Women are affected more often\\nthan are men, and symptoms usually begin in middle\\nage. Weakness may ﬁrst be noticed in the facial or\\nswallowing muscles and may progress to other mus-\\ncles.

Regular exercise, however,\\ndelays atrophy of muscles. Although muscles become\\nslower to contract and their maximal strength de-\\ncreases, exercise can maintain muscle functioning at a\\nlevel that meets whatever a person needs for daily\\nactivities. The lifting of small weights is recom-\\nmended as exercise for elderly people, women as well\\nas men. Such exercise also beneﬁts the cardiovascular,\\nrespiratory, and skeletal systems.\\nThe loss of muscle ﬁbers also contributes to a loss\\nof proprioception, because the brain is getting less\\ninformation about where and how the body is posi-\\ntioned. The loss of muscle sense contributes to\\nunsteadiness in elderly people and to an impaired\\nsense of balance, which in turn may lead to a fall.\\nSimple awareness of this may help an elderly person\\nprevent such accidents.\\nMAJOR MUSCLES OF THE BODY\\nThe actions that muscles perform are listed in T able\\n7–2 and some are shown in Fig. 7–7. Most are in pairs\\nas antagonistic functions.\\nAfter the brief summaries of the muscles of each\\nbody area that follow, the major muscles are shown in\\nFig. 7–8. They are listed, according to body area, in\\nT ables 7–3 through 7–7, with associated Figs. 7–9\\nthrough 7–13, respectively. When you study the dia-\\ngrams of these muscles, and the tables that accompany\\nthem, keep in mind the types of joints formed by the\\nbones of their origins and insertions. Muscles pull\\nbones to produce movement, and if you can remember\\nthe joints involved, you can easily learn the locations\\nand actions of the muscles.\\nThe name of the muscle may also be helpful, and\\nagain, many of the terms are ones you have already\\nlearned. Some examples: “abdominis” refers to an\\nabdominal muscle, “femoris” to a thigh muscle,\\n“brachii” to a muscle of the upper arm, “oculi” to an\\nThe Muscular System 149\\neye muscle, and so on. Other parts of muscle names\\nmay be words such as “longus” or “maximus” that\\ntell you about size, or “ﬂexor” that tells you about\\nfunction.\\nMuscles that are sites for intramuscular injections\\nare shown in Box 7–5.\\nBOX 7–5 COMMON INJECTION SITES\\nIntramuscular injections are used when rapid\\nabsorption is needed, because muscle has a\\ngood blood supply.

Some form the wall of\\nthe trunk and bend the trunk, such as the rectus abdo-\\nminis (f lexion) and the sacrospinalis group (exten-\\nsion). The trapezius (both together form the shape of\\na trapezoid) is a large muscle that can raise (shrug) the\\nshoulder or pull it back, and can help extend the head.\\nOther muscles found on the trunk help move the arm\\nat the shoulder. The pectoralis major is a large muscle\\nof the chest that pulls the arm across the chest (ﬂexion\\nand adduction). On the posterior side of the trunk, the\\nlatissimus dorsi pulls the arm downward and behind\\nthe back (extension and adduction). These muscles\\nhave their origins on the bones of the trunk, the ster-\\nnum, the or vertebrae, which are strong, stable\\nanchors. Another set of muscles forms the pelvic ﬂoor,\\nwhere the muscles support the pelvic organs and assist\\nwith urination and defecation. Y et another category is\\nthe muscles that are concerned with breathing. These\\nare the intercostal muscles between the ribs and the\\ndiaphragm that separates the thoracic and abdominal\\ncavities (see Fig. 15–6).\\nMUSCLES OF THE\\nSHOULDER AND ARM\\nThe triangular deltoid muscle covers the point of the\\nshoulder like a cap, and can pull the humerus to the\\nside (abduction), forward (flexion), or backward\\n(extension). Y ou already know the functions of the\\nbiceps brachii and triceps brachii, the muscles that\\nform the bulk of the upper arm. Other muscles par-\\ntially in the upper arm help bend the elbow (ﬂexion).\\nThe muscles that form the bulk of the forearm are the\\nﬂexors and extensors of the hand and ﬁngers.

T endons attach muscles to bone; the origin is the\\nmore stationary bone, the insertion is the more\\nmovable bone. A tendon merges with the fascia of\\na muscle and the periosteum of a bone; all are made\\nof ﬁbrous connective tissue.\\nMuscle Arrangements\\n1. Antagonistic muscles have opposite functions. A\\nmuscle pulls when it contracts, but exerts no force\\nwhen it relaxes and it cannot push. When one mus-\\ncle pulls a bone in one direction, another muscle is\\nneeded to pull the bone in the other direction (see\\nalso T able 7–2 and Fig. 7–1).\\n2. Synergistic muscles have the same function and\\nalternate as the prime mover depending on the\\nposition of the bone to be moved. Synergists also\\nstabilize a joint to make a more precise movement\\npossible.\\n3. The frontal lobes of the cerebrum generate the\\nimpulses necessary for contraction of skeletal mus-\\ncles. The cerebellum regulates coordination.\\nMuscle Tone—the state of slight contraction\\npresent in muscles\\n1. Alternate ﬁbers contract to prevent muscle fatigue;\\nregulated by the cerebellum.\\n2. Good tone helps maintain posture, produces 25%\\nof body heat (at rest), and improves coordination.\\n3. Isotonic exercise involves contraction with move-\\nment; improves tone and strength and improves\\ncardiovascular and respiratory efficiency (aerobic\\nexercise).\\n• Concentric contraction—muscle exerts force\\nwhile shortening.\\n• Eccentric contraction—muscle exerts force\\nwhile lengthening.\\n4. Isometric exercise involves contraction without\\nmovement; improves tone and strength but is not\\naerobic.\\nMuscle Sense—proprioception: knowing\\nwhere our muscles are without looking\\nat them\\n1. Permits us to perform everyday activities without\\nhaving to concentrate on muscle position.\\n2. Stretch receptors (proprioceptors) in muscles\\nrespond to stretching and generate impulses that\\nthe brain interprets as a mental “picture” of where\\nthe muscles are. Parietal lobes: conscious muscle\\nsense; cerebellum: unconscious muscle sense used\\nto promote coordination.\\nEnergy Sources for Muscle Contraction\\n1. ATP is the direct source; the ATP stored in muscles\\nlasts only a few seconds.\\n2. Creatine phosphate is a secondary energy source; is\\nbroken down to creatine /H11001phosphate /H11001energy.\\nThe energy is used to synthesize more ATP . Some\\ncreatine is converted to creatinine, which must be\\nexcreted by the kidneys. Most creatine is used for\\nthe resynthesis of creatine phosphate.\\n3. Glycogen is the most abundant energy source and\\nis ﬁrst broken down to glucose. Glucose is broken\\ndown in cell respiration:\\nGlucose /H11001O\\n2 → CO2 /H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001heat\\nATP is used for contraction; heat contributes to\\nbody temperature; H2O becomes part of intracellu-\\nlar ﬂuid; CO2 is eventually exhaled.\\n4. Oxygen is essential for the completion of cell res-\\npiration. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries\\noxygen to muscles; myoglobin stores oxygen in\\nmuscles; both of these proteins contain iron, which\\nenables them to bond to oxygen.\\n5. Oxygen debt (recovery oxygen uptake): Muscle\\nﬁbers run out of oxygen during strenuous exercise,\\nand glucose is converted to lactic acid, which causes\\nfatigue.

The central\\nnervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and\\nspinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS)\\nconsists of cranial nerves and spinal nerves. The PNS\\nincludes the autonomic nervous system (ANS).\\nThe peripheral nervous system relays information\\nto and from the central nervous system, and the brain\\nis the center of activity that integrates this informa-\\ntion, initiates responses, and makes us the individuals\\nwe are.\\nNERVE TISSUE\\nNerve tissue was brieﬂy described in Chapter 4, so we\\nwill begin by reviewing what you already know and\\nthen add to it.\\nNerve cells are called neurons, or nerve ﬁbers .\\nWhatever their speciﬁc functions, all neurons have the\\nsame physical parts. The cell body contains the\\nnucleus (Fig. 8–1) and is essential for the continued\\nlife of the neuron. As you will see, neuron cell bodies\\nare found in the central nervous system or close to it\\nin the trunk of the body. In these locations, cell bodies\\nare protected by bone. There are no cell bodies in the\\narms and legs, which are much more subject to injury.\\nDendrites are processes (extensions) that transmit\\nimpulses toward the cell body. The one axon of a neu-\\nron transmits impulses away from the cell body. It is\\nthe cell membrane of the dendrites, cell body, and\\naxon that carries the electrical nerve impulse.\\nIn the peripheral nervous system, axons and den-\\ndrites are “wrapped” in specialized cells called\\nSchwann cells (see Fig. 8–1). During embryonic\\ndevelopment, Schwann cells grow to surround the\\nneuron processes, enclosing them in several layers of\\nSchwann cell membrane. These layers are the myelin\\nsheath; myelin is a phospholipid that electrically insu-\\nlates neurons from one another. Without the myelin\\nsheath, neurons would short-circuit, just as electrical\\nwires would if they were not insulated (see Box 8–1:\\nMultiple Sclerosis).\\nThe spaces between adjacent Schwann cells, or seg-\\nments of the myelin sheath, are called nodes of\\nRanvier (neuroﬁbril nodes). These nodes are the parts\\nof the neuron cell membrane that depolarize when an\\nelectrical impulse is transmitted (see “The Nerve\\nImpulse” section, on pages 171–172).\\nThe nuclei and cytoplasm of the Schwann cells are\\nwrapped around the outside of the myelin sheath and\\nare called the neurolemma, which becomes very\\nimportant if nerves are damaged. If a peripheral nerve\\nis severed and reattached precisely by microsurgery,\\nthe axons and dendrites may regenerate through the\\ntunnels formed by the neurolemmas. The Schwann\\ncells are also believed to produce a chemical growth\\nfactor that stimulates regeneration. Although this re-\\ngeneration may take months, the nerves may eventu-\\nally reestablish their proper connections, and the\\nperson may regain some sensation and movement in\\nthe once-severed limb.\\nIn the central nervous system, the myelin sheaths\\nare formed by oligodendrocytes, one of the neu-\\nroglia (glial cells), the specialized cells found only in\\nthe brain and spinal cord. Because no Schwann cells\\nare present, however, there is no neurolemma, and\\nregeneration of neurons does not occur. This is why\\nsevering of the spinal cord, for example, results in per-\\nmanent loss of function. Another kind of neuroglia are\\nmicroglia,which are constantly moving, phagocytiz-\\ning cellular debris, damaged cells, and pathogens.\\n166 The Nervous System\\n08Scanlon(p3)-ch08  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 166'),\n",

The small gap or space\\nbetween the axon of one neuron and the dendrites or\\ncell body of the next neuron is called the synapse.\\nWithin the synaptic knob (terminal end) of the presy-\\nnaptic axon is a chemical neurotransmitter that is\\nreleased into the synapse by the arrival of an electrical\\nnerve impulse (Fig. 8–2). The neurotransmitter dif-\\nfuses across the synapse, combines with speciﬁc recep-\\ntor sites on the cell membrane of the postsynaptic\\nneuron, and there generates an electrical impulse that\\nis, in turn, carried by this neuron’s axon to the next\\nsynapse, and so forth. A chemical inactivator at the\\ncell body or dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron\\nquickly inactivates the neurotransmitter. This pre-\\nvents unwanted, continuous impulses, unless a new\\nimpulse from the ﬁrst neuron releases more neuro-\\ntransmitter.\\nMany synapses are termed excitatory, because the\\nneurotransmitter causes the postsynaptic neuron to\\ndepolarize (become more negative outside as Na\\n/H11001ions\\nenter the cell) and transmit an electrical impulse to\\nanother neuron, muscle cell, or gland. Some synapses,\\nhowever, are inhibitory, meaning that the neurotrans-\\nmitter causes the postsynaptic neuron to hyperpolar-\\nize (become even more positive outside as K\\n/H11001ions\\nleave the cell or Cl/H11002ions enter the cell) and therefore\\nnot transmit an electrical impulse. Such inhibitory\\nsynapses are important, for example, for slowing the\\nheart rate, and for balancing the excitatory impulses\\ntransmitted to skeletal muscles. With respect to the\\nskeletal muscles, this inhibition prevents excessive\\ncontraction and is important for coordination.\\n168 The Nervous System\\nBOX 8–1 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\\nprotect the axon.

Some MS patients\\nhave remissions, periods of time when their symp-\\ntoms diminish, but remissions and progression of\\nthe disease are not predictable. There is still no cure\\nfor MS, but therapies include suppression of the\\nimmune response, and interferon, which seems to\\nprolong remissions in some patients. The possibility\\nof stimulating remyelination of neurons is also\\nbeing investigated.\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating dis-\\nease; that is, it involves deterioration of the myelin\\nsheath of neurons in the central nervous system.\\nWithout the myelin sheath, the impulses of these\\nneurons are short-circuited and do not reach their\\nproper destinations, and the neuron axons are\\ndamaged and gradually die.\\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder\\nthat may be triggered by a virus or bacterial infec-\\ntion.

Visceral motor neurons form the\\nautonomic nervous system, a specialized subdivision\\nof the PNS that will be discussed later in this chapter.\\nInterneurons are found entirely within the central\\nnervous system. They are arranged so as to carry only\\nsensory or motor impulses, or to integrate these func-\\ntions. Some interneurons in the brain are concerned\\nwith thinking, learning, and memory.\\nA neuron carries impulses in only one direction.\\nThis is the result of the neuron’s structure and loca-\\ntion, as well as its physical arrangement with other\\nneurons and the resulting pattern of synapses. The\\nfunctioning nervous system, therefore, is an enormous\\nnetwork of “one-way streets,” and there is no danger\\nof impulses running into and canceling one another\\nout.\\nNERVES AND NERVE TRACTS\\nA nerve is a group of axons and/or dendrites of many\\nneurons, with blood vessels and connective tissue.\\nSensory nerves are made only of sensory neurons.\\nThe optic nerves for vision and olfactory nerves for\\nsmell are examples of nerves with a purely sensory\\nfunction. Motor nerves are made only of motor neu-\\nrons; autonomic nerves are motor nerves. A mixed\\nnerve contains both sensory and motor neurons. Most\\nof our peripheral nerves, such as the sciatic nerves in\\nthe legs, are mixed nerves.\\nThe term nerve tract refers to groups of neurons\\nwithin the central nervous system. All the neurons in\\na nerve tract are concerned with either sensory or\\nmotor activity. These tracts are often referred to as\\nwhite matter; the myelin sheaths of the neurons give\\nthem a white color.\\nTHE NERVE IMPULSE\\nThe events of an electrical nerve impulse are the same\\nas those of the electrical impulse generated in muscle\\nﬁbers, which is discussed in Chapter 7. Stated simply,\\na neuron not carrying an impulse is in a state of polar-\\nization, with Na\\n/H11001ions more abundant outside the\\ncell, and K /H11001ions and negative ions more abundant\\ninside the cell. The neuron has a positive charge on\\nthe outside of the cell membrane and a relative nega-\\ntive charge inside. A stimulus (such as a neurotrans-\\nmitter) makes the membrane very permeable to Na\\n/H11001\\nions, which rush into the cell. This brings about\\ndepolarization, a reversal of charges on the mem-\\nbrane. The outside now has a negative charge, and the\\ninside has a positive charge.\\nAs soon as depolarization takes place, the neuron\\nmembrane becomes very permeable to K\\n/H11001ions, which\\nrush out of the cell. This restores the positive charge\\noutside and the negative charge inside, and is called\\nrepolarization. (The term action potential refers to\\ndepolarization followed by repolarization.) Then the\\nsodium and potassium pumps return Na\\n/H11001ions outside\\nand K/H11001ions inside, and the neuron is ready to respond\\nto another stimulus and transmit another impulse. An\\naction potential in response to a stimulus takes place\\nvery rapidly and is measured in milliseconds. An indi-\\nvidual neuron is capable of transmitting hundreds of\\naction potentials (impulses) each second. A summary\\nof the events of nerve impulse transmission is given in\\nT able 8–2.\\nT ransmission of electrical impulses is very rapid.\\nThe presence of an insulating myelin sheath increases\\nthe velocity of impulses, since only the nodes of\\nRanvier depolarize. This is called saltatory conduc-\\ntion. Many of our neurons are capable of transmitting\\nimpulses at a speed of many meters per second.\\nImagine a person 6 feet (about 2 meters) tall who stubs\\nhis toe; sensory impulses travel from the toe to the\\nbrain in less than a second (crossing a few synapses\\nalong the way). Y ou can see how the nervous system\\ncan communicate so rapidly with all parts of the body,\\nand why it is such an important regulatory system.\\nAt synapses, nerve impulse transmission changes\\nfrom electrical to chemical and depends on the release\\nof neurotransmitters. Although diffusion across\\nsynapses is slow, the synapses are so small that this\\ndoes not signiﬁcantly affect the velocity of impulses in\\na living person.\\nTHE SPINAL CORD\\nThe spinal cord transmits impulses to and from the\\nbrain and is the integrating center for the spinal cord\\nreﬂexes. Although this statement of functions is very\\nbrief and sounds very simple, the spinal cord is of\\ngreat importance to the nervous system and to the\\nbody as a whole.\\nEnclosed within the vertebral canal and the menin-\\nges, the spinal cord is well protected from mechanical\\nThe Nervous System 171\\n08Scanlon(p3)-ch08  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 171'),\n",

In length, the spinal cord extends from the\\nforamen magnum of the occipital bone to the disc\\nbetween the ﬁrst and second lumbar vertebrae.\\nA cross-section of the spinal cord is shown in Fig.\\n8–3; refer to it as you read the following. The internal\\ngray matter is shaped like the letter H; gray matter\\nconsists of the cell bodies of motor neurons and\\ninterneurons. The external white matter is made of\\nmyelinated axons and dendrites of interneurons.\\nThese nerve ﬁbers are grouped into nerve tracts based\\non their functions. Ascending tracts (such as the dor-\\nsal columns and spinothalamic tracts) carry sensory\\nimpulses to the brain. Descending tracts (such as the\\ncorticospinal and rubrospinal tracts) carry motor\\nimpulses away from the brain. Lastly, ﬁnd the central\\ncanal; this contains cerebrospinal ﬂuid and is con-\\ntinuous with cavities in the brain called ventricles.\\nSPINAL NERVES\\nThere are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, those that emerge\\nfrom the spinal cord. The nerves are named according\\nto their respective vertebrae: 8 cervical pairs, 12 tho-\\nracic pairs, 5 lumbar pairs, 5 sacral pairs, and 1 very\\nsmall coccygeal pair. These are shown in Fig. 8–4;\\nnotice that each nerve is designated by a letter and a\\nnumber. The 8th cervical nerve is C8, the 1st thoracic\\nnerve is T1, and so on.\\nIn general, the cervical nerves supply the back of\\nthe head, neck, shoulders, arms, and diaphragm (the\\nphrenic nerves). The ﬁrst thoracic nerve also con-\\ntributes to nerves in the arms. The remaining thoracic\\nnerves supply the trunk of the body. The lumbar and\\nsacral nerves supply the hips, pelvic cavity, and legs.\\nNotice that the lumbar and sacral nerves hang below\\nthe end of the spinal cord (in order to reach their\\nproper openings to exit from the vertebral canal); this\\nis called the cauda equina, literally, the “horse’s tail.”\\nSome of the important peripheral nerves and their\\ndestinations are listed in T able 8–3.\\nEach spinal nerve has two roots, which are neurons\\nentering or leaving the spinal cord (see Fig. 8–3). The\\ndorsal root is made of sensory neurons that carry\\nimpulses into the spinal cord. The dorsal root gan-\\nglion is an enlarged part of the dorsal root that con-\\ntains the cell bodies of the sensory neurons. The term\\nganglion means a group of cell bodies outside the\\nCNS. These cell bodies are within the vertebral canal\\nand are thereby protected from injury (see Box 8–2:\\nShingles).\\nThe ventral root is the motor root; it is made of\\nthe axons of motor neurons carrying impulses from\\nthe spinal cord to muscles or glands. The cell bodies\\nof these motor neurons, as mentioned previously, are\\nin the gray matter of the spinal cord. When the two\\nnerve roots merge, the spinal nerve thus formed is a\\nmixed nerve.\\nSPINAL CORD REFLEXES\\nWhen you hear the term reﬂex, you may think of an\\naction that “just happens,” and in part this is so.

When a\\nperson recovers from chickenpox, the virus may\\nsurvive in a dormant (inactive) state in the dorsal\\nroot ganglia of some spinal nerves. For most peo-\\nple, the immune system is able to prevent reactiva-\\ntion of the virus. With increasing age, however, the\\nimmune system is not as effective, and the virus\\nmay become active and cause zoster, or shingles.\\nThe virus is present in sensory neurons, often\\nthose of the trunk, but the damage caused by the\\nvirus is seen in the skin over the affected nerve. The\\nraised, red lesions of shingles are often very painful\\nand follow the course of the nerve on the skin exter-\\nnal to it. Pain may continue even after the rash\\nheals; this is postherpetic neuralgia. Occasionally\\nthe virus may affect a cranial nerve and cause facial\\nparalysis called Bell’s palsy (7th cranial) or extensive\\nfacial lesions, or, rarely, blindness. Although not a\\ncure, some antiviral medications lessen the duration\\nof the illness. A vaccine is being developed for\\nadults. Though it may not completely prevent shin-\\ngles, it is expected to lessen the chance of posther-\\npetic neuralgia.\\nBox Figure 8–A Lesions of shingles on skin of trunk.

In this reﬂex, a tap on the patellar\\ntendon just below the kneecap causes extension of the\\nlower leg. This is a stretch reﬂex, which means that a\\nmuscle that is stretched will automatically contract.\\nRefer now to Fig. 8–5 as you read the following:\\nIn the quadriceps femoris muscle are (1) stretch\\nreceptors that detect the stretching produced by strik-\\ning the patellar tendon. These receptors generate\\nimpulses that are carried along (2) sensory neurons in\\nthe femoral nerve to (3) the spinal cord. In the spinal\\ncord, the sensory neurons synapse with (4) motor neu-\\nrons (this is a two-neuron reﬂex). The motor neurons\\nin the femoral nerve carry impulses back to (5) the\\nquadriceps femoris, the effector, which contracts and\\nextends the lower leg.\\nThe patellar reﬂex is one of many used clinically to\\ndetermine whether the nervous system is functioning\\nproperly. If the patellar reﬂex were absent in a patient,\\nthe problem could be in the thigh muscle, the femoral\\nnerve, or the spinal cord. Further testing would be\\nneeded to determine the precise break in the reﬂex\\narc. If the reﬂex is normal, however, that means that\\nall parts of the reﬂex arc are intact. So the testing of\\nreﬂexes may be a ﬁrst step in the clinical assessment of\\nneurologic damage.\\nY ou may be wondering why we have such reﬂexes,\\nthese stretch reﬂexes. What is their importance in our\\neveryday lives? Imagine a person standing upright—is\\nthe body perfectly still? No, it isn’t, because gravity\\nexerts a downward pull. However, if the body tilts to\\nthe left, the right sides of the leg and trunk are\\nstretched, and these stretched muscles automatically\\ncontract and pull the body upright again. This is the\\npurpose of stretch reﬂexes; they help keep us upright\\nwithout our having to think about doing so. If the\\nbrain had to make a decision every time we swayed a\\nbit, all our concentration would be needed just to\\nremain standing. Since these are spinal cord reﬂexes,\\nthe brain is not directly involved. The brain may\\nbecome aware that a reﬂex has taken place, but that\\ninvolves another set of neurons carrying impulses to\\nthe brain.\\nFlexor reﬂexes (or withdrawal reﬂexes ) are\\nanother type of spinal cord reﬂex. The stimulus is\\nsomething painful and potentially harmful, and the\\nresponse is to pull away from it. If you inadvertently\\ntouch a hot stove, you automatically pull your hand\\naway. Flexor reflexes are three-neuron reflexes,\\nbecause sensory neurons synapse with interneurons in\\nthe spinal cord, which in turn synapse with motor\\nneurons. Again, however, the brain does not have to\\nmake a decision to protect the body; the ﬂexor reﬂex\\ndoes that automatically (see Box 8–3: Spinal Cord\\nInjuries).

The major parts are the medulla,\\npons, and midbrain (collectively called the brain\\nstem), the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, the thala-\\nmus, and the cerebrum. These parts are shown in Fig.\\n8–6. We will discuss each part separately, but keep in\\nmind that they are all interconnected and work\\ntogether.\\nVENTRICLES\\nThe ventricles are four cavities within the brain: two\\nlateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth\\nventricle (Fig. 8–7). Each ventricle contains a capillary\\nnetwork called a choroid plexus, which forms cere-\\nbrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) from blood plasma. Cere-\\nbrospinal ﬂuid is the tissue ﬂuid of the central nervous\\nsystem; its circulation and functions will be discussed\\nin the section on meninges.\\nMEDULLA\\nThe medulla extends from the spinal cord to the pons\\nand is anterior to the cerebellum. Its functions are\\nthose we think of as vital (as in “vital signs”). The\\nmedulla contains cardiac centers that regulate heart\\nrate, vasomotor centers that regulate the diameter of\\nblood vessels and, thereby, blood pressure, and respi-\\nratory centers that regulate breathing. Y ou can see\\nwhy a crushing injury to the occipital bone may be\\nrapidly fatal—we cannot survive without the medulla.\\nAlso in the medulla are reﬂex centers for coughing,\\nsneezing, swallowing, and vomiting.\\nPONS\\nThe pons bulges anteriorly from the upper part of the\\nmedulla. Within the pons are two respiratory centers\\nthat work with those in the medulla to produce a nor-\\nmal breathing rhythm. (The function of all the respi-\\nratory centers is discussed in Chapter 15.) The many\\nother neurons in the pons ( pons is from the Latin for\\n“bridge”) connect the medulla with other parts of the\\nbrain.\\nMIDBRAIN\\nThe midbrain extends from the pons to the hypothal-\\namus and encloses the cerebral aqueduct , a tunnel\\nthat connects the third and fourth ventricles.

Nor will voluntary con-\\ntrol of these reﬂexes be possible, because inhibiting\\nimpulses from the brain can no longer reach the\\nlower segments of the spinal cord.\\nPotentially less serious injuries are those in which\\nthe spinal cord is crushed rather than severed, and\\ntreatment is aimed at preserving whatever function\\nremains. Minimizing inﬂammation and stimulating\\nthe production of nerve growth factors are aspects\\nof such treatment.\\nPerhaps the most challenging research is the\\nattempt to stimulate severed spinal cords to regen-\\nerate. Partial success has been achieved in rats\\nand mice, with Schwann cells transplanted from\\ntheir peripheral nerves and nerve growth factors\\nproduced by genetically engineered cells. The use\\nof stem cells has also been successful in rats. The\\nresearchers caution, however, that it will take some\\ntime before their procedures will be tested on\\npeople.\\nInjuries to the spinal cord are most often caused by\\nauto accidents, falls, and gunshot wounds. The\\nmost serious injury is transection, or severing, of the\\nspinal cord. If, for example, the spinal cord is sev-\\nered at the level of the 8th thoracic segment, there\\nwill be paralysis and loss of sensation below that\\nlevel. Another consequence is spinal shock, the at-\\nleast-temporary loss of spinal cord reﬂexes. In this\\nexample, the spinal cord reﬂexes of the lower trunk\\nand legs will not occur. The stretch reﬂexes and\\nﬂexor reﬂexes of the legs will be at least temporar-\\nily abolished, as will the urination and defecation\\nreﬂexes. Although these reﬂexes do not depend\\ndirectly on the brain, spinal cord neurons depend\\non impulses from the brain to enhance their own\\nability to generate impulses.\\nAs spinal cord neurons below the injury recover\\ntheir ability to generate impulses, these reﬂexes,\\nsuch as the patellar reﬂex, often return.

T urning your head (ear) to\\na sound is an example of an auditory reﬂex. The mid-\\nbrain is also concerned with what are called righting\\nreﬂexes, those that keep the head upright and main-\\ntain balance or equilibrium.\\nCEREBELLUM\\nThe cerebellum is separated from the medulla and\\npons by the fourth ventricle and is inferior to the\\noccipital lobes of the cerebrum. As you already know,\\nmany of the functions of the cerebellum are concerned\\nwith movement. These include coordination, regula-\\ntion of muscle tone, the appropriate trajectory and\\nendpoint of movements, and the maintenance of pos-\\nture and equilibrium. Notice that these are all invol-\\nuntary; that is, the cerebellum functions below the\\nlevel of conscious thought. This is important to permit\\nthe conscious brain to work without being overbur-\\ndened. If you decide to pick up a pencil, for example,\\nthe impulses for arm movement come from the cere-\\nbrum. The cerebellum then modiﬁes these impulses so\\nthat your arm and ﬁnger movements are coordinated,\\nand you don’t reach past the pencil.\\nThe cerebellum seems also to be involved in certain\\nsensory functions. For example, if you close your eyes\\nand someone places a tennis ball in one hand and a\\nbaseball in the other, could you tell which was which?\\nCertainly you could, by the “feel” of each: the texture\\nand the weight or heft. If you pick up a plastic con-\\ntainer of coffee (with a lid on it) could you tell if the\\ncup is full, half-full, or empty? Again, you certainly\\ncould. Do you have to think about it? No. The cere-\\nbellum is, in part, responsible for this ability.\\nT o regulate equilibrium, the cerebellum (and mid-\\nbrain) uses information about gravity and movement\\nprovided by receptors in the inner ears. These recep-\\ntors are discussed further in Chapter 9.\\nHYPOTHALAMUS\\nLocated superior to the pituitary gland and inferior to\\nthe thalamus, the hypothalamus is a small area of the\\nbrain with many diverse functions:\\n178 The Nervous System\\nLateral ventricles\\nParietal lobe\\nOccipital lobe\\nCerebral aqueduct\\nFourth ventricle\\nCerebellum\\nCentral canal of spinal cord\\nMedulla\\nPons\\nTemporal lobe\\nThird ventricle\\nFigure 8–7.

Production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and\\noxytocin; these hormones are then stored in the\\nposterior pituitary gland. ADH enables the kidneys\\nto reabsorb water back into the blood and thus\\nhelps maintain blood volume. Oxytocin causes con-\\ntractions of the uterus to bring about labor and\\ndelivery.\\n2. Production of releasing hormones (also called\\nreleasing factors) that stimulate the secretion of\\nhormones by the anterior pituitary gland. Because\\nthese hormones are covered in Chapter 10, a single\\nexample will be given here: The hypothalamus pro-\\nduces growth hormone releasing hormone\\n(GHRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary\\ngland to secrete growth hormone (GH).\\n3. Regulation of body temperature by promoting\\nresponses such as sweating in a warm environment\\nor shivering in a cold environment (see Chapter\\n17).\\n4. Regulation of food intake; the hypothalamus is\\nbelieved to respond to changes in blood nutrient\\nlevels, to chemicals secreted by fat cells, and to hor-\\nmones secreted by the gastrointestinal tract. For\\nexample, during a meal, after a certain duration of\\ndigestion, the small intestine produces a hormone\\nthat circulates to the hypothalamus and brings\\nabout a sensation of satiety, or fullness, and we tend\\nto stop eating.\\n5. Integration of the functioning of the autonomic\\nnervous system, which in turn regulates the activity\\nof organs such as the heart, blood vessels, and\\nintestines. This will be discussed in more detail\\nlater in this chapter.\\n6. Stimulation of visceral responses during emotional\\nsituations. When we are angry, heart rate usually\\nincreases. Most of us, when embarrassed, will blush,\\nwhich is vasodilation in the skin of the face. These\\nresponses are brought about by the autonomic\\nnervous system when the hypothalamus perceives a\\nchange in emotional state. The neurologic basis of\\nour emotions is not well understood, and the vis-\\nceral responses to emotions are not something most\\nof us can control.\\n7. Regulation of body rhythms such as secretion of\\nhormones, sleep cycles, changes in mood, or men-\\ntal alertness. This is often referred to as our bio-\\nlogical clock, the rhythms as circadian rhythms,\\nmeaning “about a day.” If you have ever had to stay\\nawake for 24 hours, you know how disorienting it\\ncan be, until the hypothalamic biological clock has\\nbeen reset.\\nTHALAMUS\\nThe thalamus is superior to the hypothalamus and\\ninferior to the cerebrum. The third ventricle is a nar-\\nrow cavity that passes through both the thalamus and\\nhypothalamus. Many of the functions of the thalamus\\nare concerned with sensation. Sensory impulses to the\\nbrain (except those for the sense of smell) follow neu-\\nron pathways that ﬁrst enter the thalamus, which\\ngroups the impulses before relaying them to the cere-\\nbrum, where sensations are felt. For example, holding\\na cup of hot coffee generates impulses for heat, touch\\nand texture, and the shape of the cup (muscle sense),\\nbut we do not experience these as separate sensations.\\nThe thalamus integrates the impulses from the cuta-\\nneous receptors and from the cerebellum, that is, puts\\nthem together in a sort of electrochemical package, so\\nthat the cerebrum feels the whole and is able to inter-\\npret the sensation quickly.\\nSome sensations, especially unpleasant ones such as\\npain, are believed to be felt by the thalamus. However,\\nthe thalamus cannot localize the sensation; that is, it\\ndoes not know where the painful sensation is. The\\nsensory areas of the cerebrum are required for local-\\nization and precise awareness.\\nThe thalamus may also suppress unimportant\\nsensations. If you are reading an enjoyable book, you\\nmay not notice someone coming into the room. By\\ntemporarily blocking minor sensations, the thalamus\\npermits the cerebrum to concentrate on important\\ntasks.\\nParts of the thalamus are also involved in alertness\\nand awareness (being awake and knowing we are), and\\nothers contribute to memory. For these functions, as\\nfor others, the thalamus works very closely with the\\ncerebrum.\\nCEREBRUM\\nThe largest part of the human brain is the cerebrum,\\nwhich consists of two hemispheres separated by the\\nlongitudinal ﬁssure. At the base of this deep groove is\\nthe corpus callosum, a band of 200 million neurons\\nthat connects the right and left hemispheres. Within\\neach hemisphere is a lateral ventricle.\\nThe surface of the cerebrum is gray matter called\\nthe cerebral cortex. Gray matter consists of cell bod-\\nies of neurons, which carry out the many functions of\\nthe cerebrum. Internal to the gray matter is white\\nmatter, made of myelinated axons and dendrites that\\nconnect the lobes of the cerebrum to one another and\\nto all other parts of the brain.\\nThe Nervous System 179\\n08Scanlon(p3)-ch08  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 179'),\n",

The thick outermost layer,\\nmade of ﬁbrous connective tissue, is the dura mater\\n(Latin for “tough mother”), which lines the skull and\\nvertebral canal. The middle arachnoid membrane\\n(arachnids are spiders) is made of web-like strands of\\nconnective tissue. The innermost pia mater (Latin for\\n“gentle mother”) is a very thin membrane on the sur-\\nface of the spinal cord and brain. Between the arach-\\nnoid and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space ,\\nwhich contains cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), the tissue\\nﬂuid of the central nervous system.\\nRecall the ventricles (cavities) of the brain: two lat-\\neral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ven-\\ntricle. Each contains a choroid plexus, a capillary\\nnetwork that forms cerebrospinal ﬂuid from blood\\nplasma. This is a continuous process, and the cere-\\nbrospinal ﬂuid then circulates in and around the cen-\\ntral nervous system (Fig. 8–10).\\nFrom the lateral and third ventricles, cerebrospinal\\nﬂuid ﬂows through the fourth ventricle, then to the\\ncentral canal of the spinal cord, and to the cranial and\\nspinal subarachnoid spaces. As more cerebrospinal\\nﬂuid is formed, you might expect that some must be\\nreabsorbed, and that is just what happens. From the\\ncranial subarachnoid space, cerebrospinal ﬂuid is reab-\\nsorbed through arachnoid villi into the blood in\\ncranial venous sinuses (large veins within the\\ndouble-layered cranial dura mater). The cerebrospinal\\nﬂuid becomes blood plasma again, and the rate of\\nreabsorption normally equals the rate of production.\\nSince cerebrospinal ﬂuid is tissue ﬂuid, one of its\\nfunctions is to bring nutrients to CNS neurons and to\\nremove waste products to the blood as the ﬂuid is\\nreabsorbed. The other function of cerebrospinal ﬂuid\\nis to act as a cushion for the central nervous system.\\nThe brain and spinal cord are enclosed in ﬂuid-ﬁlled\\nmembranes that absorb shock. Y ou can, for example,\\nshake your head vigorously without harming your\\nbrain. Naturally, this protection has limits; very sharp\\nor heavy blows to the skull will indeed cause damage\\nto the brain.\\nExamination of cerebrospinal ﬂuid may be used in\\nthe diagnosis of certain diseases (see Box 8–8: Lumbar\\nPuncture).\\n184 The Nervous System\\nBOX 8–7 PARKINSON’S DISEASE\\nParkinson’s disease is a disorder of the basal\\nganglia whose cause is unknown, and though\\nthere is a genetic component in some families, it\\nis probably not the only factor. The disease usu-\\nally begins after the age of 60. Neurons in the\\nbasal ganglia that produce the neurotransmitter\\ndopamine begin to degenerate and die, and the\\ndeﬁciency of dopamine causes speciﬁc kinds\\nof muscular symptoms. Tremor, or involuntary\\nshaking, of the hands is probably the most com-\\nmon symptom. The accessory movements regu-\\nlated by the basal ganglia gradually diminish,\\nand the affected person walks slowly without\\nswinging the arms. A mask-like face is character-\\nistic of this disease, as the facial muscles become\\nrigid. Eventually all voluntary movements be-\\ncome slower and much more difficult, and bal-\\nance is seriously impaired.\\nDopamine itself cannot be used to treat\\nParkinson’s disease because it does not cross the\\nblood–brain barrier. A substance called \\nL-dopa\\ndoes cross and can be converted to dopamine by\\nbrain neurons. Unfortunately, \\nL-dopa begins to\\nlose its therapeutic effectiveness within a few\\nyears.\\nOther medications in use do not provide a\\ncure. Some researchers suggest that implants of\\nstem cells may offer the best hope of meaningful\\ntherapy.\\n08Scanlon(p3)-ch08  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 184'),\n",

These are the visceral effectors ;\\nmuscle will either contract or relax, and glands will\\neither increase or decrease their secretions.\\nThe ANS has two divisions: sympathetic and\\nparasympathetic. Often, they function in opposition\\nto each other, as you will see. The activity of both divi-\\nsions is integrated by the hypothalamus, which\\nensures that the visceral effectors will respond appro-\\npriately to the situation.\\nAUTONOMIC PATHWAYS\\nAn autonomic nerve pathway from the central nervous\\nsystem to a visceral effector consists of two motor\\nneurons that synapse in a ganglion outside the CNS\\n(Fig. 8–12). The ﬁrst neuron is called the pregan-\\nglionic neuron, from the CNS to the ganglion. The\\nsecond neuron is called the postganglionic neuron,\\nfrom the ganglion to the visceral effector.

FA Davis, Philadelphia, 2000, Plate\\n52, with permission.)\\nA lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is a diagnostic\\nprocedure that involves the removal of cere-\\nbrospinal ﬂuid to determine its pressure and con-\\nstituents. As the name tells us, the removal, using a\\nsyringe, is made in the lumbar area. Because the\\nspinal cord ends between the 1st and 2nd lumbar\\nvertebrae, the needle is usually inserted between\\nthe 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae. The meningeal\\nsac containing cerebrospinal ﬂuid extends to the\\nend of the lumbar vertebrae, permitting access to\\nthe cerebrospinal ﬂuid with little chance of damag-\\ning the spinal cord.\\nCerebrospinal ﬂuid is a circulating ﬂuid and has\\na normal pressure of 70 to 200 mmH\\n2O. An abnor-\\nmal pressure usually indicates an obstruction in cir-\\nculation, which may be caused by infection, a\\ntumor, or mechanical injury. Other diagnostic\\ntests would be needed to determine the precise\\ncause.\\nPerhaps the most common reason for a lumbar\\npuncture is suspected meningitis, which may be\\ncaused by several kinds of bacteria. If the patient\\ndoes have meningitis, the cerebrospinal ﬂuid will be\\ncloudy rather than clear and will be examined for\\nthe presence of bacteria and many white blood\\ncells. A few WBCs in CSF is normal, because WBCs\\nare found in all tissue ﬂuid.\\nAnother abnormal constituent of cerebrospinal\\nﬂuid is red blood cells. Their presence indicates\\nbleeding somewhere in the central nervous system.\\nThere may be many causes, and again, further test-\\ning would be necessary.\\n08Scanlon(p3)-ch08  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 187'),\n",

With this anatomic arrangement,\\nvery localized (one organ) responses are possible.\\nThe parasympathetic division dominates in relaxed\\n(non-stress) situations to promote normal functioning\\nof several organ systems.

Peripheral nervous system (PNS)—cranial nerves\\nand spinal nerves.\\nNerve Tissue—neurons (nerve ﬁbers) and\\nspecialized cells (Schwann, neuroglia)\\n1. Neuron cell body contains the nucleus; cell bodies\\nare in the CNS or in the trunk and are protected by\\nbone.\\n2. Axon carries impulses away from the cell body;\\ndendrites carry impulses toward the cell body.\\n3. Schwann cells in PNS: Layers of cell membrane\\nform the myelin sheath to electrically insulate neu-\\nrons; nodes of Ranvier are spaces between adjacent\\nSchwann cells. Nuclei and cytoplasm of Schwann\\ncells form the neurolemma, which is essential for\\nregeneration of damaged axons or dendrites.\\n4. Oligodendrocytes in CNS form the myelin\\nsheaths; microglia phagocytize pathogens and\\ndamaged cells; astrocytes contribute to the\\nblood–brain barrier (see T able 8–1).\\n5. Synapse—the space between the axon of one neu-\\nron and the dendrites or cell body of the next neu-\\nron. A neurotransmitter carries the impulse across\\na synapse and is then destroyed by a chemical inac-\\ntivator. Synapses make impulse transmission one\\nway in the living person.\\nTypes of Neurons—nerve ﬁbers\\n1. Sensory—carry impulses from receptors to the\\nCNS; may be somatic (from skin, skeletal muscles,\\njoints) or visceral (from internal organs).\\n2. Motor—carry impulses from the CNS to effectors;\\nmay be somatic (to skeletal muscle) or visceral (to\\nsmooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands). Visceral\\nmotor neurons make up the autonomic nervous\\nsystem.\\n3. Interneurons—entirely within the CNS.\\nNerves and Nerve Tracts\\n1. Sensory nerve—made only of sensory neurons.\\n2. Motor nerve—made only of motor neurons.\\n3. Mixed nerve—made of both sensory and motor\\nneurons.\\n4. Nerve tract—a nerve within the CNS; also called\\nwhite matter.\\nThe Nerve Impulse—see Table 8–2\\n1. Polarization—neuron membrane has a ( /H11001) charge\\noutside and a (/H11002) charge inside.\\n2. Depolarization—entry of Na\\n/H11001ions and reversal of\\ncharges on either side of the membrane.\\n3. Impulse transmission is rapid, often several meters\\nper second.\\n• Saltatory conduction—in a myelinated neuron\\nonly the nodes of Ranvier depolarize; increases\\nspeed of impulses.\\nThe Spinal Cord\\n1. Functions: transmits impulses to and from the\\nbrain, and integrates the spinal cord reﬂexes.\\n2. Location: within the vertebral canal; extends from\\nthe foramen magnum to the disc between the 1st\\nand 2nd lumbar vertebrae.\\n3. Cross-section: internal H-shaped gray matter con-\\ntains cell bodies of motor neurons and interneu-\\nrons; external white matter is the myelinated axons\\nand dendrites of interneurons.\\n4. Ascending tracts carry sensory impulses to the\\nbrain; descending tracts carry motor impulses away\\nfrom the brain.\\n5.

The\\nsenses of taste and smell enable us to enjoy the ﬂavor\\nof our food or warn us that food has spoiled and may\\nbe dangerous to eat. Our sense of equilibrium keeps us\\nupright. We also get information from our senses\\nabout what is happening inside the body. The pain of\\na headache, for example, prompts us to do something\\nabout it, such as take aspirin. In general, this is the\\npurpose of sensations: to enable the body to respond\\nappropriately to ever-changing situations and main-\\ntain homeostasis.\\nSENSORY PATHWAY\\nThe impulses involved in sensations follow very pre-\\ncise pathways, which all have the following parts:\\n1. Receptors—detect changes (stimuli) and generate\\nimpulses. Receptors are usually very speciﬁc with\\nrespect to the kinds of changes they respond to.\\nThose in the retina detect light rays, those in the\\nnasal cavities detect vapors, and so on. Once a spe-\\nciﬁc stimulus has affected receptors, however, they\\nall respond in the same way by generating electri-\\ncal nerve impulses.\\n2. Sensory neurons—transmit impulses from recep-\\ntors to the central nervous system. These sensory\\nneurons are found in both spinal nerves and cranial\\nnerves, but each carries impulses from only one\\ntype of receptor.\\n3. Sensory tracts—white matter in the spinal cord or\\nbrain that transmits the impulses to a speciﬁc part\\nof the brain.\\n4. Sensory areas —most are in the cerebral cortex.\\nThese areas feel and interpret the sensations.\\nLearning to interpret sensations begins in infancy,\\nwithout our awareness of it, and continues through-\\nout life.\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF SENSATIONS\\nCertain characteristics of sensations will help you\\nunderstand how the sensory areas work with informa-\\ntion from the receptors.\\n1. Projection—the sensation seems to come from the\\narea where the receptors were stimulated. If you\\ntouch this book, the sensation of touch seems to be\\nin your hand but is actually being felt by your cere-\\nbral cortex. That it is indeed the brain that feels\\nsensations is demonstrated by patients who feel\\nphantom pain after amputation of a limb. After\\nloss of a hand, for example, the person may still feel\\nthat the hand is really there. Why does this hap-\\npen? The receptors in the hand are no longer pres-\\nent, but the severed nerve endings continue to\\ngenerate impulses. These impulses arrive in the\\nparietal lobe area for the hand, and the brain does\\nwhat it has always done and creates the projection,\\nthe feeling that the hand is still there. For most\\namputees, phantom pain diminishes as the severed\\nnerves heal, but the person often experiences a\\nphantom “presence” of the missing part. This may\\nbe helpful when learning to use an artiﬁcial limb.\\n2. Intensity—some sensations are felt more distinctly\\nand to a greater degree than are others. A weak\\nstimulus such as dim light will affect a small num-\\nber of receptors, but a stronger stimulus, such as\\nbright sunlight, will stimulate many more recep-\\ntors. When more receptors are stimulated, more\\nimpulses will arrive in the sensory area of the brain.\\nThe brain “counts” the impulses and projects a\\nmore intense sensation.\\n3. Contrast—the effect of a previous or simultaneous\\nsensation on a current sensation, which may then\\nbe exaggerated or diminished. Again, this is a func-\\ntion of the brain, which constantly compares sensa-\\ntions. If, on a very hot day, you jump into a\\nswimming pool, the water may feel quite cold at\\nﬁrst. The brain compares the new sensation to the\\nprevious one, and since there is a signiﬁcant differ-\\nence between the two, the water will seem colder\\nthan it actually is.\\n4. Adaptation—becoming unaware of a continuing\\nstimulus. Receptors detect changes, but if the stim-\\nulus continues it may not be much of a change, and\\nthe receptors will generate fewer impulses. The\\nwater in the swimming pool that seemed cold at\\nﬁrst seems to “warm up” after a few minutes. The\\nwater has not changed temperature, and the recep-\\ntors for cold have no changes to detect, therefore\\nthey generate fewer impulses. The sensation of\\ncold lessens, and we interpret or feel that as\\nincreasing warmth. For another example, look at\\nyour left wrist (or perhaps the right one). Many of\\nus wear a watch and are probably unaware of its\\n198 The Senses\\n09Scanlon(p3)-ch09  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 198'),\n",

The cuta-\\nneous receptors for touch or pressure adapt very\\nquickly to a continuing stimulus, and if there is no\\nchange, there is nothing for the receptors to detect.\\n5. After-image—the sensation remains in the con-\\nsciousness even after the stimulus has stopped. A\\nfamiliar example is the bright after-image seen after\\nwatching a ﬂashbulb go off. The very bright light\\nstrongly stimulates receptors in the retina, which\\ngenerate many impulses that are perceived as an\\nintense sensation that lasts longer than the actual\\nstimulus.\\nCUTANEOUS SENSES\\nThe dermis of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue\\ncontain receptors for the sensations of touch, pressure,\\nheat, cold, and pain. The receptors for pain, heat, and\\ncold are free nerve endings , which also respond to\\nany intense stimulus. Intense pressure, for example,\\nmay be felt as pain. The receptors for touch and pres-\\nsure are encapsulated nerve endings , meaning that\\nthere is a cellular structure around the nerve ending\\n(Fig. 9–1).\\nThe cutaneous senses provide us with informa-\\ntion about the external environment and also about\\nthe skin itself. Much of the information about the\\nenvironment is not of great importance and is\\nprocessed at a subconscious level (suppressed by the\\nthalamus), though we can choose to be aware of it. For\\nexample, could you distinguish a cotton T-shirt from\\ndenim jeans by touch alone? Probably, but you might\\nnot realize that you can do that until you try it by, say,\\nsorting laundry in the dark.

Y es, you could.\\nBut are we usually aware of the sensation from the\\nsoles of our feet? If all is going well, probably not.\\nSome people with diabetes develop diabetic neuropa-\\nthy, damage to nerves that impairs sensation, and they\\nmay say that a wood ﬂoor feels like walking on cotton\\nballs or that the buttons of a shirt feel too large or too\\nsmall. They are aware of such odd sensations simply\\nbecause the feelings are odd. For most of us, the touch\\nof the wood ﬂoor is not brought to awareness because\\nit is what the brain expects from past experience,\\nbut if the ﬂoor has splinters or if the beach sand is hot,\\nwe are certainly aware. This is information we can\\nbring to our conscious minds if necessary, but usually\\ndo not.\\nAs for the skin itself, if you have ever had poison ivy\\nor chickenpox, you may remember the itching sensa-\\ntion of the rash. An itch is actually a mild pain sensa-\\ntion, which may become real pain if not scratched.\\nWhy does scratching help relieve some itches, besides\\nby removing an external irritant? One proposed\\nmechanism is that scratching is a bit more painful than\\nthe itch, and the impulses it generates can distract the\\nbrain from the impulses from the itch. Scratching will\\nnot help relieve the itch of poison ivy, chickenpox, or\\na mosquito bite, however, because the irritating chem-\\nicals are in the skin, not on it. In such cases, scratch-\\ning may do more damage and worsen inﬂammation at\\nthe site.\\nThe sensory areas for the skin are in the parietal\\nlobes. Y ou may recall from Chapter 5 that the sensi-\\ntivity of an area of skin is determined by the number\\nof receptors present. The number of receptors corre-\\nsponds to the size of the sensory area in the cerebral\\ncortex. The largest parts of this sensory cortex are for\\nthe parts of the skin with the most receptors, that is,\\nthe hands and face.\\nAs mentioned previously, sensory areas are not\\nmerely passive recipients of impulses. Consider the\\nsensation of wetness. It is a distinct sensation, but\\nthere are no receptors for “wet” in the skin. Where\\ndoes the sensation come from? Where all sensation\\ncomes from: the brain. The parietal lobes have learned\\nto associate the simultaneous reception of temperature\\nand pressure impulses with “wet.” Y ou can demon-\\nstrate this for yourself by putting on a plastic glove\\nand dunking your ﬁngers in a cup of water. Y our ﬁn-\\ngers will feel wet, though they are perfectly dry inside\\nthe glove. Wetness is a learned sensation, created by\\nthe brain.\\nREFERRED PAIN\\nFree nerve endings are also found in internal organs.\\nThe smooth muscle of the small intestine, for exam-\\nple, has free nerve endings that are stimulated by\\nexcessive stretching or contraction; the resulting pain\\nis called visceral pain. Sometimes pain that originates\\nin an internal organ may be felt in a cutaneous area;\\nthis is called referred pain. The pain of a heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction) may be felt in the left arm and\\nshoulder, or the pain of gallstones may be felt in the\\nright shoulder.\\nThis referred pain is actually a creation of the\\nbrain. Within the spinal cord are sensory tracts\\nthat are shared by cutaneous impulses and visceral\\nimpulses. Cutaneous impulses are much more fre-\\nquent, and the brain correctly projects the sensation to\\nthe skin. When the impulses come from an organ such\\nas the heart, however, the brain may still project the\\nsensation to the “usual” cutaneous area. The brain\\nprojects sensation based on past experience, and cuta-\\nneous pain is far more common than visceral pain.\\nKnowledge of referred pain, as in the examples men-\\ntioned earlier, may often be helpful in diagnosis.\\nMUSCLE SENSE\\nMuscle sense (also called proprioception or kines-\\nthetic sense) was discussed in Chapter 7 and will be\\nreviewed only brieﬂy here. Stretch receptors (also\\ncalled proprioceptors or muscle spindles) detect\\nstretching of muscles and generate impulses, which\\nenable the brain to create a mental picture to know\\nwhere the muscles are and how they are positioned.\\nConscious muscle sense is felt by the parietal lobes.\\nUnconscious muscle sense is used by the cerebellum\\nto coordinate voluntary movements. We do not have\\nto see our muscles to be sure that they are performing\\ntheir intended actions. Muscle sense also contributes\\nto our ability to distinguish the shape of objects.\\nSENSE OF TASTE\\nThe receptors for taste are found in taste buds, most\\nof which are in papillae on the tongue (Fig. 9–2).\\nThese chemoreceptors detect chemicals in solution\\nin the mouth. The chemicals are foods and the solvent\\nis saliva (if the mouth is very dry, taste is very\\n200 The Senses\\n09Scanlon(p3)-ch09  8/17/06  10:48 AM  Page 200'),\n",

There are ﬁve (perhaps more) general\\ntypes of taste receptors: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and\\nsavory. Savory (also called umami or glutamate) is a\\ntaste like grilled meat. We experience many more dif-\\nferent tastes, however, because foods are often com-\\nplex chemicals that stimulate different combinations\\nof receptors, and the sense of smell also contributes to\\nour perception of food.\\nSome taste preferences have been found to be\\ngenetic. People with more than the average number of\\ntaste buds ﬁnd broccoli very bitter, whereas people\\nwith fewer taste buds may like the taste.\\nThe impulses from taste buds are transmitted by\\nthe facial and glossopharyngeal (7th and 9th cranial)\\nnerves to the taste areas in the parietal-temporal cor-\\ntex. The sense of taste is important because it makes\\neating enjoyable. Some medications may interfere\\nwith the sense of taste, and this sense becomes less\\nacute as we get older. These may be contributing fac-\\ntors to poor nutrition in certain patients and in the\\nelderly.\\nSENSE OF SMELL\\nThe receptors for smell (olfaction) are chemorecep-\\ntors that detect vaporized chemicals that have been\\nsniffed into the upper nasal cavities (see Fig. 9–2). Just\\nas there are speciﬁc taste receptors, there are also\\nspeciﬁc scent receptors, and research indicates that\\nhumans have several hundred different receptors.\\nWhen stimulated by vapor molecules, olfactory re-\\nceptors generate impulses carried by the olfactory\\nnerves (1st cranial) through the ethmoid bone to the\\nolfactory bulbs. The pathway for these impulses ends\\nin the olfactory areas of the temporal lobes. Vapors\\nmay stimulate many combinations of receptors, and it\\nhas been estimated that the human brain is capable of\\ndistinguishing among 10,000 different scents.\\nThat may seem impressive, but the human sense of\\nsmell is very poorly developed compared to those\\nof other animals. Dogs, for example, have a sense of\\nsmell about 2000 times more acute than that of peo-\\nple. (It has been said that most people live in a world\\nof sights, whereas dogs live in a world of smells.) As\\nmentioned earlier, however, much of what we call taste\\nis actually the smell of food. If you have a cold and\\nyour nasal cavities are stuffed up, food just doesn’t\\ntaste as good as it usually does. Adaptation occurs rel-\\natively quickly with odors. Pleasant scents may be\\nsharply distinct at ﬁrst but rapidly seem to dissipate or\\nfade, and even unpleasant scents may fade with long\\nexposure.\\nHUNGER AND THIRST\\nHunger and thirst may be called visceral sensations,\\nin that they are triggered by internal changes. Hunger\\nis a sensation that seems to be far more complex than\\nwas ﬁrst thought, but thirst seems to be somewhat\\nsimpler. The receptors for both senses are specialized\\ncells in the hypothalamus. Receptors for hunger are\\nbelieved to detect changes in blood nutrient levels, the\\nblood levels of hormones from the stomach and small\\nintestine, and a hormone released by adipose tissue; all\\nof these chemical signals are collected by the hypo-\\nthalamus. The receptors for thirst detect changes in\\nthe body water content, which is actually the water-to-\\nsalt proportion.\\nNaturally we do not feel these sensations in the\\nhypothalamus: They are projected. Hunger is pro-\\njected to the stomach, which contracts. Thirst is pro-\\njected to the mouth and pharynx, and less saliva is\\nproduced.\\nIf not satisﬁed by eating, the sensation of hunger\\ngradually diminishes, that is, adaptation occurs. The\\nreason is that after blood nutrient levels decrease, they\\nbecome stable as fat in adipose tissue is used for\\nenergy. With little or no digestive activity in the gas-\\ntrointestinal tract, secretion of hormones diminishes.\\nWith no sharp ﬂuctuations of the chemical signals, the\\nreceptors in the hypothalamus have few changes to\\ndetect, and hunger becomes much less intense.\\nIn contrast, the sensation of thirst, if not satisﬁed by\\ndrinking, continues to worsen. There is no adaptation.\\nAs body water is lost, the amount keeps decreasing\\nand does not stabilize. Therefore, there are constant\\nchanges for the receptors to detect, and prolonged\\nthirst may be painful.\\nTHE EYE\\nThe eye contains the receptors for vision and a\\nrefracting system that focuses light rays on the recep-\\ntors in the retina. We will begin our discussion, how-\\never, with the accessory structures of the eye, then\\nlater return to the eye itself and the physiology of\\nvision.\\n202 The Senses\\n09Scanlon(p3)-ch09  8/17/06  10:49 AM  Page 202'),\n",

Inﬂammation of this membrane,\\ncalled conjunctivitis, may be caused by allergies or by\\ncertain bacteria or viruses, and makes the eyes red,\\nitchy, and watery.\\nTears are produced by the lacrimal glands ,\\nlocated at the upper, outer corner of the eyeball,\\nwithin the orbit (Fig. 9–3). Secretion of tears occurs\\nconstantly, but is increased by the presence of irri-\\ntating chemicals (onion vapors, for example) or dust,\\nand in certain emotional situations (sad or happy).\\nSmall ducts take tears to the anterior of the eyeball,\\nand blinking spreads the tears and washes the surface\\nof the eye. T ears are mostly water, with about 1%\\nsodium chloride, similar to other body ﬂuids. T ears\\nalso contain lysozyme, an enzyme that inhibits the\\ngrowth of most bacteria on the wet, warm surface\\nof the eye. At the medial corner of the eyelids are\\ntwo small openings into the superior and inferior\\nlacrimal canals.

The six extrin-\\nsic muscles of the eye (Fig. 9–4) are attached to this\\nbony socket and to the surface of the eyeball. There\\nare four rectus (straight) muscles that move the eyeball\\nup and down or side to side; the name tells you which\\ndirection. The medial rectus muscle, for example,\\npulls the eyeball medially, as if to look at the nose. The\\ntwo oblique (slanted) muscles rotate the eye. The cra-\\nnial nerves that innervate these muscles are the oculo-\\nmotor, trochlear, and abducens (3rd, 4th, and 6th\\ncranial nerves, respectively). The very rapid and com-\\nplex coordination of these muscles in both eyes is, for-\\ntunately, not something we have to think about.

The sclera is the thickest layer and is made of\\nﬁbrous connective tissue that is visible as the white of\\nthe eye. The most anterior portion is the cornea,\\nwhich differs from the rest of the sclera in that it is\\ntransparent. The cornea has no capillaries, covers the\\niris and pupil inside the eye, and is the ﬁrst part of the\\neye that refracts, or bends, light rays.\\nThe choroid layer contains blood vessels and a\\ndark blue pigment (derived from melanin) that\\nabsorbs light within the eyeball and thereby prevents\\nglare (just as does the black interior of a camera). The\\nanterior portion of the choroid is modiﬁed into more\\nspecialized structures: the ciliary body and the iris.\\nThe ciliary body (muscle) is a circular muscle that\\nsurrounds the edge of the lens and is connected to the\\nlens by suspensory ligaments. The lens is made of a\\ntransparent, elastic protein, and, like the cornea, has\\nno capillaries (see Box 9–1: Cataracts). The shape of\\nthe lens is changed by the ciliary muscle, which\\nenables the eye to focus light from objects at varying\\ndistances from the eye.\\nJust in front of the lens is the circular iris, the col-\\nored part of the eye; its pigment is a form of melanin.\\nWhat we call “eye color” is the color of the iris and is\\na genetic characteristic, just as skin color is.

Pupillary constriction is a reﬂex that\\nprotects the retina from intense light or that permits\\nmore acute near vision, as when reading.\\nThe retina lines the posterior two-thirds of the\\neyeball and contains the visual receptors, the rods and\\ncones (Fig. 9–6).

The larger, posterior\\ncavity is found between the lens and retina and con-\\ntains vitreous humor (or vitreous body). This semi-\\nsolid substance keeps the retina in place. If the eyeball\\nis punctured and vitreous humor is lost, the retina may\\nfall away from the choroid; this is one possible cause\\nof a detached retina.\\nThe anterior cavity is found between the back of\\nthe cornea and the front of the lens, and contains\\naqueous humor , the tissue ﬂuid of the eyeball.\\nAqueous humor is formed by capillaries in the ciliary\\nbody, ﬂows anteriorly through the pupil, and is reab-\\nsorbed by the canal of Schlemm (small veins also\\ncalled the scleral venous sinus) at the junction of the\\niris and cornea. Because aqueous humor is tissue ﬂuid,\\nyou would expect it to have a nourishing function, and\\nit does. Recall that the lens and cornea have no capil-\\nlaries; they are nourished by the continuous ﬂow of\\naqueous humor (see Box 9–2: Glaucoma).\\nPHYSIOLOGY OF VISION\\nFor us to see, light rays must be focused on the retina,\\nand the resulting nerve impulses must be trans-\\nmitted to the visual areas of the cerebral cortex in the\\nbrain.\\nRefraction of light rays is the deﬂection or bend-\\ning of a ray of light as it passes through one object and\\ninto another object of greater or lesser density. The\\nrefraction of light within the eye takes place in the fol-\\nlowing pathway of structures: the cornea, aqueous\\nhumor, lens, and vitreous humor. The lens is the only\\nadjustable part of the refraction system. When looking\\nat distant objects, the ciliary muscle is relaxed and the\\nlens is elongated and thin. When looking at near\\nobjects, the ciliary muscle contracts to form a smaller\\ncircle, the elastic lens recoils and bulges in the middle,\\nand has greater refractive power (see Box 9–3: Errors\\nof Refraction).\\nWhen light rays strike the retina, they stimulate\\nchemical reactions in the rods and cones. In rods, the\\nchemical rhodopsin breaks down to form scotopsin\\nand retinal (a derivative of vitamin A). This chem-\\nical reaction generates an electrical impulse, and\\nrhodopsin is then resynthesized in a slower reaction.\\nAdaptation to darkness, such as going outside at night,\\ntakes a little while because being in a well-lit area has\\nbroken down most of the rhodopsin in the rods, and\\nresynthesis of rhodopsin is slow. The opposite situa-\\ntion, perhaps being suddenly awakened by a bright\\nlight, can seem almost painful. What happens is this:\\nIn darkness the rods have resynthesized a full supply of\\nrhodopsin, and the sudden bright light breaks down\\nall the rhodopsin at the same time.

If\\nthese or other medications are not effective, laser\\nsurgery may be used to create a larger drainage\\ncanal.\\nAnyone over the age of 40 should have a test for\\nglaucoma; anyone with a family history of glau-\\ncoma should have this test annually, as should those\\nwith diabetes or high blood pressure.

It is believed that there are three types of cones:\\nred-absorbing, blue-absorbing, and green-absorbing\\ncones. Each type absorbs wavelengths over about a\\nthird of the visible light spectrum, so red cones,\\nfor example, absorb light of the red, orange, and\\nyellow wavelengths. The chemical reactions in cones\\nalso generate electrical impulses (see Box 9–4: Night\\nBlindness and Color Blindness).\\nThe impulses from the rods and cones are trans-\\nmitted to ganglion neurons (see Fig. 9–6); these con-\\nverge at the optic disc and become the optic nerve,\\nwhich passes posteriorly through the wall of the eye-\\nball. Ganglion neurons also seem to have a photo-\\nreceptor chemical (called melanopsin) that may\\ncontribute to the daily resetting of our biological\\nclocks.\\nThe optic nerves from both eyes come together at\\nthe optic chiasma (or chiasm), just in front of the\\npituitary gland (see Fig. 8–11). Here, the medial ﬁbers\\nof each optic nerve cross to the other side.

Although each eye transmits a slightly\\ndifferent picture (look straight ahead and close one\\neye at a time to see the difference between the two pic-\\ntures), the visual areas put them together, or integrate\\nthem, to make a single image that has depth and three\\ndimensions. This is called binocular vision . The\\nvisual areas also right the image, because the image on\\nthe retina is upside down. The image on ﬁlm in a cam-\\nera is also upside down, but we don’t even realize that\\nbecause we look at the pictures right side up. The\\nbrain just as automatically ensures that we see our\\nworld right side up.\\nAlso for near vision, the pupils constrict to block\\nout peripheral light rays that would otherwise blur the\\nimage, and the eyes converge even further to keep the\\nimages on the corresponding parts of both retinas.\\nThe Senses 209\\nBOX 9–4 NIGHT BLINDNESS AND COLOR BLINDNESS\\ncolor blindness on his X chromosome has no gene\\nat all for color vision on his Y chromosome and will\\nbe color blind.\\nNight blindness, the inability to see well in dim\\nlight or at night, is usually caused by a deﬁciency of\\nvitamin A, although some night blindness may\\noccur with aging. Vitamin A is necessary for the syn-\\nthesis of rhodopsin in the rods.

The ear contains\\nthe receptors for two senses: hearing and equilib-\\nrium. These receptors are all found in the inner ear.\\nOUTER EAR\\nThe outer ear consists of the auricle and the ear\\ncanal. The auricle, or pinna, is made of cartilage cov-\\nered with skin. For animals such as dogs, whose ears\\nare movable, the auricle may act as a funnel for sound\\nwaves. For people, however, the ﬂat and stationary\\nauricle is not important. Hearing would not be nega-\\ntively affected without it, although those of us who\\nwear glasses would have our vision impaired without\\nour auricles. The ear canal is lined with skin that con-\\ntains ceruminous glands. It may also be called the\\nexternal auditory meatus , and is a tunnel into the\\ntemporal bone, curving slightly forward and down.\\nMIDDLE EAR\\nThe middle ear is an air-ﬁlled cavity in the temporal\\nbone. The eardrum, or tympanic membrane , is\\nstretched across the end of the ear canal and vibrates\\nwhen sound waves strike it. These vibrations are\\ntransmitted to the three auditory bones: the malleus,\\nincus, and stapes (see Fig. 9–7). The stapes then\\ntransmits vibrations to the ﬂuid-ﬁlled inner ear at the\\noval window.\\nThe eustachian tube (auditory tube) extends from\\nthe middle ear to the nasopharynx and permits air to\\nenter or leave the middle ear cavity. The air pressure\\nin the middle ear must be the same as the external\\natmospheric pressure in order for the eardrum to\\nvibrate properly. Y ou may have noticed your ears\\n“popping” when in an airplane or when driving to a\\nhigher or lower altitude. Swallowing or yawning cre-\\nates the “pop” by opening the eustachian tubes and\\nequalizing the air pressures.\\nThe eustachian tubes of children are short and\\nnearly horizontal and may permit bacteria to spread\\nfrom the pharynx to the middle ear. This is why otitis\\nmedia may be a complication of a strep throat.\\nINNER EAR\\nWithin the temporal bone, the inner ear is a cavity\\ncalled the bony labyrinth (a labyrinth is a series of\\ninterconnecting paths or tunnels, somewhat like a\\nmaze but without dead ends; see Fig. 9–7), which is\\nlined with membrane called the membranous\\nlabyrinth.

The receptors are\\ncalled hair cells (their projections are not “hair,” of\\ncourse, but rather are specialized microvilli called\\nstereocilia), which contain endings of the cochlear\\nbranch of the 8th cranial nerve. Overhanging the hair\\ncells is the tectorial membrane (Fig. 9–9).\\nVery simply, the process of hearing involves the\\ntransmission of vibrations and the generation of nerve\\nimpulses. When sound waves enter the ear canal,\\nvibrations are transmitted by the following sequence\\nof structures: eardrum, malleus, incus, stapes, oval\\nwindow of the inner ear, and perilymph and\\nendolymph within the cochlea. Imagine the vibrations\\nin the ﬂuids as ripples or waves. The basilar mem-\\nbrane ripples and pushes the hair cells of the organ of\\nCorti against the tectorial membrane. When the hair\\ncells bend, they generate impulses that are carried by\\nthe 8th cranial nerve to the brain. As you may recall,\\nthe auditory areas are in the temporal lobes of the\\ncerebral cortex. It is here that sounds are heard and\\ninterpreted (see Box 9–5: Deafness).\\nThe auditory areas also enable us to determine\\nfrom which direction a sound is coming. Simply\\nstated, the auditory areas count and compare the num-\\nber of impulses coming from each inner ear. For\\nexample, if more impulses arrive from the left cochlea\\nthan from the right one, the sound will be projected to\\nthe left. If the source of a sound is directly above your\\nhead, the sound may seem to come from all directions,\\nbecause each auditory area is receiving approximately\\nthe same number of impulses and cannot project the\\nsensation to one side or the other.\\nThe ﬁnal structure in the hearing pathway is the\\nround window (see Fig. 9–8).

The aortic arch, which\\nreceives blood pumped by the left ventricle of the\\nheart, curves over the top of the heart. The left and\\nright carotid arteries are branches of the aortic arch\\nthat take blood through the neck on the way to the\\nbrain. In each of these vessels are pressoreceptors and\\nchemoreceptors (see Fig. 12–7).\\nPressoreceptors in the carotid sinuses and aortic\\nsinus detect changes in blood pressure. Chemorecep-\\ntors in the carotid bodies and the aortic body detect\\nchanges in the oxygen and carbon dioxide content and\\nthe pH of blood. The impulses generated by these\\nreceptors do not give rise to sensations that we feel but\\nrather are information used to make any necessary\\nchanges in respiration or circulation. We will return\\nto this in later chapters, so one example will suffice\\nfor now.\\nIf the blood level of oxygen decreases signiﬁcantly,\\nthis change (hypoxia) is detected by carotid and aortic\\nchemoreceptors. The sensory impulses are carried by\\nthe glossopharyngeal (9th cranial) and vagus (10th\\ncranial) nerves to the medulla. Centers in the medulla\\nmay then increase the respiratory rate and the heart\\nrate to obtain and circulate more oxygen. These are\\nthe respiratory and cardiac reﬂexes that were men-\\ntioned in Chapter 8 as functions of the glossopha-\\nryngeal and vagus nerves. The importance of these\\nreﬂexes is readily apparent: to maintain normal blood\\nlevels of oxygen and carbon dioxide and to maintain\\nnormal blood pressure.\\nAGING AND THE SENSES\\nAll of the senses may be diminished in old age. In the\\neye, cataracts may make the lens opaque. The lens\\nalso loses its elasticity and the eye becomes more\\nfarsighted, a condition called presbyopia. The risk\\nof glaucoma increases, and elderly people should be\\ntested for it because treatment is available that can\\nprevent blindness. Macular degeneration, in which\\ncentral vision becomes impaired ﬁrst, is a major cause\\nof vision loss for people over 65. Reading and close\\nwork of any kind become difficult.\\nIn the ear, cumulative damage to the hair cells in\\nthe organ of Corti usually becomes apparent some\\ntime after the age of 60. Hair cells that have been\\ndamaged in a lifetime of noise cannot be replaced\\n(regrowth of cochlear hair cells has been stimulated in\\nguinea pigs, but not yet in people). The deafness of\\nold age ranges from slight to profound; very often\\nhigh-pitched sounds are lost ﬁrst, while hearing\\nmay still be adequate for low-pitched sounds. The\\nsense of equilibrium may be diminished; the body is\\nslower to react to tilting, and falls may become more\\nfrequent.\\nBoth taste and smell become less acute with age,\\nwhich may contribute to poor nutrition in elderly\\npeople.\\nSUMMARY\\nChanges take place all around us as well as within\\nus. If the body could not respond appropriately to\\nenvironmental and internal changes, homeostasis\\nwould soon be disrupted, resulting in injury, illness, or\\neven death. T o respond appropriately to changes, the\\nbrain must know what they are. Conveying this infor-\\nmation to our brains is the function of our senses.\\nAlthough we may sometimes take our senses for\\ngranted, we could not survive for very long without\\nthem.\\nY ou have just read about the great variety of inter-\\nnal and external changes that are detected by the sense\\norgans. Y ou are also familiar with the role of the nerv-\\nous system in the regulation of the body’s responses.\\nIn the next chapter we will discuss the other regula-\\ntory system, the endocrine system. The hormones\\nof the endocrine glands are produced in response to\\nchanges, and their regulatory effects all contribute to\\nhomeostasis.\\n216 The Senses\\nBOX 9–6 MOTION SICKNESS\\nMotion sickness is characterized by cold sweats,\\nhyperventilation, nausea, and vomiting when the\\nperson is exposed to repetitive motion that is\\nunexpected or unfamiliar, or that cannot be con-\\ntrolled. Seasickness is a type of motion sickness,\\nas is carsickness (why children are carsick more\\noften than adults is not known).\\nSome people are simply not affected by the\\nrolling of a ship or train; for others, the constant\\nstimulation of the receptors for position ﬁrst\\nbecomes uncomfortable, then nauseating. For\\nthose who know they are susceptible to motion\\nsickness, medications are available for use before\\ntraveling by plane, train, boat, or car.\\n09Scanlon(p3)-ch09  8/17/06  10:49 AM  Page 216'),\n",

Each\\nhormone then exerts very speciﬁc effects on certain\\norgans, called target organs or target tissues. Some\\nhormones, such as insulin and thyroxine, have many\\ntarget organs. Other hormones, such as calcitonin and\\nsome pituitary gland hormones, have only one or a\\nfew target organs.\\nIn general, the endocrine system and its hormones\\nhelp regulate growth, the use of foods to produce\\nenergy, resistance to stress, the pH of body ﬂuids and\\nﬂuid balance, and reproduction. In this chapter we will\\ndiscuss the speciﬁc functions of the hormones and\\nhow each contributes to homeostasis.\\nCHEMISTRY OF HORMONES\\nWith respect to their chemical structure, hormones\\nmay be classiﬁed into three groups: amines, proteins,\\nand steroids.\\n1. Amines—these simple hormones are structural\\nvariations of the amino acid tyrosine. This group\\nincludes thyroxine from the thyroid gland and epi-\\nnephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal\\nmedulla.\\n2. Proteins—these hormones are chains of amino\\nacids. Insulin from the pancreas, growth hormone\\nfrom the anterior pituitary gland, and calcitonin\\nfrom the thyroid gland are all proteins. Short\\nchains of amino acids may be called peptides.\\nAntidiuretic hormone and oxytocin, synthesized by\\nthe hypothalamus, are peptide hormones.\\n3. Steroids—cholesterol is the precursor for the\\nsteroid hormones, which include cortisol and aldos-\\nterone from the adrenal cortex, estrogen and pro-\\ngesterone from the ovaries, and testosterone from\\nthe testes.\\nREGULATION OF\\nHORMONE SECRETION\\nHormones are secreted by endocrine glands when\\nthere is a need for them, that is, for their effects on\\ntheir target organs. The cells of endocrine glands\\nrespond to changes in the blood or perhaps to other\\nhormones in the blood. These stimuli are the infor-\\nmation they use to increase or decrease secretion of\\ntheir own hormones. When a hormone brings about\\nits effects, the stimulus is reversed, and secretion of\\nthe hormone decreases until the stimulus reoccurs.\\nY ou may recall from Chapter 1 that this is a negative\\nfeedback mechanism, and the mechanism for thyrox-\\nine was depicted in Fig. 1–3. Let us use insulin as a dif-\\nferent example here.\\nInsulin is secreted by the pancreas when the blood\\nglucose level is high; that is, hyperglycemia is the\\nstimulus for secretion of insulin. Once circulating\\nin the blood, insulin enables cells to remove glucose\\nfrom the blood so that it can be used for energy\\nproduction and enables the liver to store glucose\\nas glycogen. As a result of these actions of insulin,\\nthe blood glucose level decreases, reversing the stim-\\nulus for secretion of insulin. Insulin secretion then\\ndecreases until the blood glucose level increases\\nagain.\\nIn any hormonal negative feedback mechanism ,\\ninformation about the effects of the hormone is “fed\\nback” to the gland, which then decreases its secretion\\nof the hormone. This is why the mechanism is called\\n“negative”: The effects of the hormone reverse the\\nstimulus and decrease the secretion of the hormone.\\nThe secretion of many other hormones is regulated in\\na similar way.\\nThe hormones of the anterior pituitary gland are\\nsecreted in response to releasing hormones (also\\ncalled releasing factors) secreted by the hypothalamus.\\nY ou may recall this from Chapter 8. Growth hormone,\\nfor example, is secreted in response to growth hor-\\nmone–releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypo-\\nthalamus. As growth hormone exerts its effects, the\\nsecretion of GHRH decreases, which in turn decreases\\nthe secretion of growth hormone. This is another type\\nof negative feedback mechanism.\\nFor each of the hormones to be discussed in this\\nchapter, the stimulus for its secretion will also be men-\\ntioned. Some hormones function as an antagonistic\\npair to regulate a particular aspect of blood chemistry;\\nthese mechanisms will also be covered.\\nTHE PITUITARY GLAND\\nThe pituitary gland (or hypophysis) hangs by a short\\nstalk (infundibulum) from the hypothalamus and is\\nenclosed by the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone.\\nThe Endocrine System 225\\n10Scanlon(p3)-ch10  8/17/06  10:50 AM  Page 225'),\n",

CRH is produced in any type of phys-\\niological stress situation such as injury, disease, exer-\\ncise, or hypoglycemia (being hungry is stressful).\\nProlactin\\nProlactin, as its name suggests, is responsible for lac-\\ntation. More precisely, prolactin initiates and main-\\ntains milk production by the mammary glands. The\\nregulation of secretion of prolactin is complex, involv-\\ning both prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and\\nprolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH) from the hypo-\\nthalamus. The mammary glands must ﬁrst be acted\\nupon by other hormones such as estrogen and proges-\\nterone, which are secreted in large amounts by the\\nplacenta during pregnancy. Then, after delivery of the\\nbaby, prolactin secretion increases and milk is pro-\\nduced.

FSH is named for\\none of its functions in women. Within the ovaries are\\novarian follicles that contain potential ova (egg cells).\\nFSH stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles; that is,\\nit initiates egg development in cycles of approximately\\n28 days. FSH also stimulates secretion of estrogen by\\nthe follicle cells. In men, FSH initiates sperm produc-\\ntion within the testes.\\nThe secretion of FSH is stimulated by the hypo-\\nthalamus, which produces gonadotropin-releasing\\nhormone (GnRH). FSH secretion is decreased by\\ninhibin, a hormone produced by the ovaries or testes.\\nLuteinizing Hormone\\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) is another gonadotropic\\nhormone. In women, LH is responsible for ovulation,\\nthe release of a mature ovum from an ovarian follicle.\\nLH then stimulates that follicle to develop into the\\ncorpus luteum, which secretes progesterone, also\\nunder the inﬂuence of LH.

The target organs of aldosterone\\nare the kidneys, but there are important secondary\\neffects as well. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption\\nof sodium and the excretion of potassium by the kid-\\nney tubules. Sodium ions (Na\\n/H11001) are returned to the\\nblood, and potassium ions (K /H11001) are excreted in urine.\\nLook at Fig. 10–10 as you read the following.\\nAs Na /H11001ions are reabsorbed, hydrogen ions (H /H11001)\\nmay be excreted in exchange. This is one mechanism\\nto prevent the accumulation of excess H\\n/H11001ions, which\\nwould cause acidosis of body ﬂuids. Also, as Na /H11001ions\\nare reabsorbed, negative ions such as chloride (Cl /H11002)\\nand bicarbonate (HCO3\\n–) follow the Na/H11001ions back to\\nthe blood, and water follows by osmosis. This indirect\\neffect of aldosterone, the reabsorption of water by the\\nkidneys, is very important to maintain normal blood\\nvolume and blood pressure. In summary, then, aldos-\\nterone maintains normal blood levels of sodium and\\npotassium, and contributes to the maintenance of nor-\\nmal blood pH, blood volume, and blood pressure.\\nA number of factors stimulate the secretion of\\naldosterone. These are a deﬁciency of sodium, loss of\\nblood or dehydration that lowers blood pressure, or an\\nelevated blood level of potassium. Low blood pressure\\nor blood volume activates the renin-angiotensin\\nmechanism of the kidneys. This mechanism is dis-\\ncussed in Chapters 13 and 18, so we will say for now\\nthat the process culminates in the formation of a\\nchemical called angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes\\nvasoconstriction and stimulates the secretion of aldos-\\nterone by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone then\\nincreases sodium and water retention by the kidneys\\nto help restore blood volume and blood pressure to\\nnormal.\\nCortisol\\nWe will use cortisol as a representative of the group\\nof hormones called glucocorticoids, because it is\\nresponsible for most of the actions of this group\\n(Fig. 10–11).

Estrogen promotes the maturation of the\\novum in the ovarian follicle and stimulates the growth\\nof blood vessels in the endometrium (lining) of the\\nuterus in preparation for a possible fertilized egg.\\nThe secondary sex characteristics in women also\\ndevelop in response to estrogen. These include\\ngrowth of the duct system of the mammary glands,\\ngrowth of the uterus, and the deposition of fat subcu-\\ntaneously in the hips and thighs. The closure of the\\nepiphyseal discs in long bones is brought about by\\nestrogen, and growth in height stops. Estrogen is also\\nbelieved to lower blood levels of cholesterol and tri-\\nglycerides. For women before the age of menopause\\nthis is beneﬁcial in that it decreases the risk of athero-\\nsclerosis and coronary artery disease.\\nResearch suggests that estrogen no longer be con-\\nsidered only a “female” hormone. Estrogen seems to\\nhave effects on many organs, including the brain, the\\nheart, and blood vessels. In the brain, testosterone\\nfrom the testes or the adrenal cortex can be converted\\nto estrogen, which may be important for memory,\\nespecially for older people. Estrogen seems to have\\nnon-reproductive functions in both men and women,\\nalthough we cannot yet be as speciﬁc as we can be\\nwith the reproductive functions in women, mentioned\\npreviously.\\nPROGESTERONE\\nWhen a mature ovarian follicle releases an ovum, the\\nfollicle becomes the corpus luteum and begins to\\nsecrete progesterone in addition to estrogen.

Inhibin helps decrease the secretion of FSH\\nby the anterior pituitary gland, and GnRH by the\\nhypothalamus.\\nTESTES\\nThe testes are located in the scrotum, a sac of skin\\nbetween the upper thighs.

At puberty,\\ntestosterone stimulates development of the male sec-\\nondary sex characteristics.

For example, the\\nstomach and duodenum produce hormones that regu-\\nlate aspects of digestion and appetite. Adipose tissue\\nproduces the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin.\\nThe thymus gland produces hormones necessary for\\nthe normal functioning of the immune system, and the\\nkidneys produce a hormone that stimulates red blood\\ncell production. All of these will be discussed in later\\nchapters.\\nPROSTAGLANDINS\\nProstaglandins (PGs) are made by virtually all cells\\nfrom the phospholipids of their cell membranes. They\\ndiffer from other hormones in that they do not circu-\\nlate in the blood to target organs, but rather exert\\ntheir effects locally, where they are produced.\\nThere are many types of prostaglandins, designated\\nby the letters A through I, as in PGA, PGB, and so on.\\nProstaglandins have many functions, and we will list\\nonly a few of them here. Prostaglandins are known to\\nbe involved in inﬂammation, pain mechanisms, blood\\nclotting, vasoconstriction and vasodilation, contrac-\\ntion of the uterus, reproduction, secretion of digestive\\nglands, and nutrient metabolism. Current research\\nis directed at determining the normal functioning of\\nprostaglandins in the hope that many of them may\\neventually be used clinically.\\nOne familiar example may illustrate the widespread\\nactivity of prostaglandins. For minor pain such as a\\nheadache, many people take aspirin. Aspirin inhibits\\nthe synthesis of prostaglandins involved in pain mech-\\nanisms and usually relieves the pain. Some people,\\nhowever, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis, may\\ntake large amounts of aspirin to diminish pain and\\ninﬂammation. These people may bruise easily because\\nblood clotting has been impaired. This too is an effect\\nof aspirin, which blocks the synthesis of prostaglan-\\ndins necessary for blood clotting.\\nMECHANISMS OF\\nHORMONE ACTION\\nExactly how hormones exert their effects on their tar-\\nget organs involves a number of complex processes,\\nwhich will be presented simply here.\\nA hormone must ﬁrst bond to a receptor for it on\\nor in the target cell. Cells respond to certain hor-\\nmones and not to others because of the presence of\\nspeciﬁc receptors, which are proteins. These receptor\\nproteins may be part of the cell membrane or within\\nthe cytoplasm or nucleus of the target cells. A hor-\\nmone will affect only those cells that have its speciﬁc\\nreceptors. Liver cells, for example, have cell mem-\\nbrane receptors for insulin, glucagon, growth hor-\\nmone, and epinephrine; bone cells have receptors for\\ngrowth hormone, PTH, and calcitonin. Cells of the\\novaries and testes do not have receptors for PTH and\\ncalcitonin, but do have receptors for FSH and LH,\\nwhich bone cells and liver cells do not have. Once a\\nhormone has bonded to a receptor on or in its target\\ncell, other reactions will take place.\\nTHE TWO-MESSENGER MECHANISM—\\nPROTEIN HORMONES\\nThe two-messenger mechanism of hormone action\\ninvolves “messengers” that make something happen,\\nthat is, stimulate speciﬁc reactions. Protein hor-\\nmones usually bond to receptors of the cell mem-\\nbrane, and the hormone is called the ﬁrst messenger.\\nThe hormone–receptor bonding activates the enzyme\\nadenyl cyclase on the inner surface of the cell mem-\\nbrane. Adenyl cyclase synthesizes a substance called\\ncyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic AMP or\\ncAMP) from ATP , and cyclic AMP is the second mes-\\nsenger.\\nCyclic AMP activates speciﬁc enzymes within the\\ncell, which bring about the cell’s characteristic\\nresponse to the hormone. These responses include a\\nchange in the permeability of the cell membrane to a\\nspeciﬁc substance, an increase in protein synthesis,\\nactivation of other enzymes, or the secretion of a cel-\\nlular product.\\nIn summary, a cell’s response to a hormone is deter-\\nmined by the enzymes within the cell, that is, the reac-\\ntions of which the cell is capable. These reactions are\\nbrought about by the ﬁrst messenger, the hormone,\\nwhich stimulates the formation of the second messen-\\nger, cyclic AMP . Cyclic AMP then activates the cell’s\\nenzymes to elicit a response to the hormone (Fig.\\n10–12).\\nACTION OF STEROID HORMONES\\nSteroid hormones are soluble in the lipids of the cell\\nmembrane and diffuse easily into a target cell.

The enzymes produced bring about the cell’s\\ncharacteristic response to the hormone (see Fig.\\n10–12).\\nAGING AND THE\\nENDOCRINE SYSTEM\\nMost of the endocrine glands decrease their secretions\\nwith age, but normal aging usually does not lead to\\nserious hormone deﬁciencies. There are decreases in\\nadrenol cortical hormones, for example, but the levels\\nare usually sufficient to maintain homeostasis of water,\\nelectrolytes, and nutrients. The decreased secretion of\\ngrowth hormone leads to a decrease in muscle mass\\nand an increase in fat storage.

As you\\nknow, however, the blood of one individual is not\\nalways compatible with that of another person. The\\nABO blood types were discovered in the early 1900s\\nby Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian-American. He\\nalso contributed to the discovery of the Rh factor in\\n1940. In the early 1940s, Charles Drew, an African-\\nAmerican, developed techniques for processing and\\nstoring blood plasma, which could then be used in\\ntransfusions for people with any blood type. When we\\ndonate blood today, our blood may be given to a recip-\\nient as whole blood, or it may be separated into its\\ncomponent parts, and recipients will then receive only\\nthose parts they need, such as red cells, plasma, factor\\n8, or platelets. Each of these parts has a speciﬁc func-\\ntion, and all of the functions of blood are essential to\\nour survival.\\nThe general functions of blood are transportation,\\nregulation, and protection. Materials transported by\\nthe blood include nutrients, waste products, gases, and\\nhormones. The blood helps regulate ﬂuid–electrolyte\\nbalance, acid–base balance, and the body temperature.\\nProtection against pathogens is provided by white\\nblood cells, and the blood clotting mechanism prevents\\nexcessive loss of blood after injuries. Each of these\\nfunctions is covered in more detail in this chapter.\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF BLOOD\\nBlood has distinctive physical characteristics:\\nAmount—a person has 4 to 6 liters of blood, depend-\\ning on his or her size. Of the total blood volume in\\nthe human body, 38% to 48% is composed of the\\nvarious blood cells, also called formed elements. The\\nremaining 52% to 62% of the blood volume is\\nplasma, the liquid portion of blood (Fig. 11–1).\\nColor—you’re probably saying to yourself, “Of\\ncourse, it’s red!” Mention is made of this obvious\\nfact, however, because the color does vary. Arterial\\nblood is bright red because it contains high levels of\\noxygen. Venous blood has given up much of its oxy-\\ngen in tissues, and has a darker, dull red color. This\\nmay be important in the assessment of the source of\\nbleeding. If blood is bright red, it is probably from\\na severed artery, and dark red blood is probably\\nvenous blood.\\npH—the normal pH range of blood is 7.35 to 7.45,\\nwhich is slightly alkaline. Venous blood normally\\nhas a lower pH than does arterial blood because of\\nthe presence of more carbon dioxide.\\nViscosity—this means thickness or resistance to ﬂow.\\nBlood is about three to ﬁve times thicker than\\nwater. Viscosity is increased by the presence of\\nblood cells and the plasma proteins, and this thick-\\nness contributes to normal blood pressure.\\nPLASMA\\nPlasma is the liquid part of blood and is approxi-\\nmately 91% water. The solvent ability of water\\nenables the plasma to transport many types of sub-\\nstances. Nutrients absorbed in the digestive tract, such\\nas glucose, amino acids, and minerals, are circulated to\\nall body tissues. Waste products of the tissues, such as\\nurea and creatinine, circulate through the kidneys and\\nare excreted in urine. Hormones produced by\\nendocrine glands are carried in the plasma to their tar-\\nget organs, and antibodies are also transported in\\nplasma. Most of the carbon dioxide produced by cells\\nis carried in the plasma in the form of bicarbonate ions\\n(HCO\\n3\\n–). When the blood reaches the lungs, the CO2\\nis re-formed, diffuses into the alveoli, and is exhaled.\\nAlso in the plasma are the plasma proteins. The\\nclotting factors prothrombin, ﬁbrinogen, and others\\nare synthesized by the liver and circulate until acti-\\nvated to form a clot in a ruptured or damaged blood\\nvessel. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein.\\nIt too is synthesized by the liver. Albumin contributes\\nto the colloid osmotic pressure of blood, which pulls\\ntissue ﬂuid into capillaries. This is important to main-\\ntain normal blood volume and blood pressure. Other\\nplasma proteins are called globulins. Alpha and beta\\nglobulins are synthesized by the liver and act as carri-\\ners for molecules such as fats. The gamma globulins\\nare antibodies produced by lymphocytes. Antibodies\\ninitiate the destruction of pathogens and provide us\\nwith immunity.\\nPlasma also carries body heat. Heat is one of the\\nby-products of cell respiration (the production of ATP\\nin cells). Blood is warmed by ﬂowing through active\\norgans such as the liver and muscles. This heat is dis-\\ntributed to cooler parts of the body as blood continues\\nto circulate.\\n252 Blood\\n11Scanlon(p3)-ch11  8/17/06  10:52 AM  Page 252'),\n",

Blood cells are pro-\\nduced from stem cells in hemopoietic tissue . After\\nbirth this is primarily the red bone marrow , found\\nin ﬂat and irregular bones such as the sternum,\\nhip bone, and vertebrae. Lymphocytes mature and\\ndivide in lymphatic tissue , found in the spleen,\\nlymph nodes, and thymus gland. The thymus contains\\nstem cells that produce T lymphocytes, and the stem\\ncells in other lymphatic tissue also produce lympho-\\ncytes.\\nRED BLOOD CELLS\\nAlso called erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBCs)\\nare biconcave discs, which means their centers are\\nthinner than their edges. Y ou may recall from Chapter\\n3 that red blood cells are the only human cells with-\\nout nuclei. Their nuclei disintegrate as the red blood\\ncells mature and are not needed for normal func-\\ntioning.\\nA normal RBC count ranges from 4.5 to 6.0 million\\ncells per microliter ( /H9262L) of blood (1 microliter /H110051\\nmm\\n3 /H11005one millionth of a liter, a very small volume).\\nRBC counts for men are often toward the high end of\\nthis range; those for women are often toward the low\\nend. Another way to measure the amount of RBCs is\\nthe hematocrit. This test involves drawing blood into\\na thin glass tube called a capillary tube, and centrifug-\\ning the tube to force all the cells to one end. The per-\\ncentages of cells and plasma can then be determined.\\nBecause RBCs are by far the most abundant of the\\nblood cells, a normal hematocrit range is just like that\\nof the total blood cells: 38% to 48%. Both RBC count\\nand hematocrit (Hct) are part of a complete blood\\ncount (CBC).\\nFunction\\nRed blood cells contain the protein hemoglobin\\n(Hb), which gives them the ability to carry oxygen.\\nEach red blood cell contains approximately 300 mil-\\nlion hemoglobin molecules, each of which can bond to\\nfour oxygen molecules (see Box Fig. 3–B). In the pul-\\nmonary capillaries, RBCs pick up oxygen and oxyhe-\\nmoglobin is formed. In the systemic capillaries,\\nhemoglobin gives up much of its oxygen and becomes\\nreduced hemoglobin. A determination of hemoglobin\\nlevel is also part of a CBC; the normal range is 12 to\\n18 grams per 100 mL of blood. Essential to the for-\\nmation of hemoglobin is the mineral iron; there are\\nfour atoms of iron in each molecule of hemoglobin. It\\nis the iron that actually bonds to the oxygen and also\\nmakes RBCs red.\\nHemoglobin is also able to bond to carbon dioxide\\n(CO\\n2), and does transport some CO 2 from the tissues\\nto the lungs. But hemoglobin accounts for only about\\n10% of total CO\\n2 transport (most is carried in the\\nplasma as bicarbonate ions).\\nProduction and Maturation\\nRed blood cells are formed in red bone marrow (RBM)\\nin ﬂat and irregular bones. Within red bone marrow\\nare precursor cells called stem cells . Recall from\\nChapter 3 that stem cells are unspecialized cells that\\nmay develop, or differentiate, in several ways. The\\nstem cells of the red bone marrow may also be called\\nhemocytoblasts (hemo /H11005“blood,” cyto /H11005“cell,” blast\\n/H11005“producing”), and they constantly undergo mitosis\\nto produce all the kinds of blood cells, many of which\\nare RBCs (Figs. 11–2 and 11–3). The rate of produc-\\ntion is very rapid (estimated at several million new\\nRBCs per second), and a major regulating factor is\\noxygen. If the body is in a state of hypoxia, or lack of\\noxygen, the kidneys produce a hormone called ery-\\nthropoietin, which stimulates the red bone marrow to\\nincrease the rate of RBC production (that is, the rate\\nof stem cell mitosis). This will occur following hemor-\\nrhage or if a person stays for a time at a higher altitude.\\nAs a result of the action of erythropoietin, more RBCs\\nwill be available to carry oxygen and correct the\\nhypoxic state.\\nThe stem cells that will become RBCs go through\\na number of developmental stages, only the last two of\\nwhich we will mention (see Fig. 11–2). The nor-\\nmoblast is the last stage with a nucleus, which then\\ndisintegrates. The reticulocyte has fragments of the\\nendoplasmic reticulum, which are visible when blood\\nsmears are stained for microscopic evaluation. These\\nimmature cells are usually found in the red bone mar-\\nrow, although a small number of reticulocytes in the\\nperipheral circulation is considered normal (up to\\n1.5% of the total RBCs). Large numbers of reticulo-\\ncytes or normoblasts in the circulating blood mean\\nthat the number of mature RBCs is not sufficient to\\n254 Blood\\n11Scanlon(p3)-ch11  8/17/06  10:52 AM  Page 254'),\n",

This may cause jaundice, a con-\\ndition in which the whites of the eyes appear yellow.\\nThis yellow color may also be seen in the skin of light-\\nskinned people (see Box 11–2: Jaundice).\\nBlood Types\\nOur blood types are genetic; that is, we inherit genes\\nfrom our parents that determine our own types. There\\nare many red blood cell factors or types; we will dis-\\ncuss the two most important ones: the ABO group\\nand the Rh factor. (The genetics of blood types is dis-\\ncussed in Chapter 21.)\\nThe ABO group contains four blood types: A, B,\\nAB, and O. The letters A and B represent antigens\\n(protein-oligosaccharides) on the red blood cell mem-\\nbrane. A person with type A blood has the A antigen\\non the RBCs, and someone with type B blood has the\\nB antigen. T ype AB means that both A and B antigens\\nare present, and type O means that neither the A nor\\nthe B antigen is present.\\nCirculating in the plasma of each person are natu-\\nral antibodies for those antigens not present on the\\nRBCs. Therefore, a type A person has anti-B antibod-\\nies in the plasma; a type B person has anti-A antibod-\\nies; a type AB person has neither anti-A nor anti-B\\nantibodies; and a type O person has both anti-A and\\nanti-B antibodies (see T able 11–1 and Fig. 11–5).\\nThese natural antibodies are of great importance\\nfor transfusions. If possible, a person should receive\\nBlood 259\\nBOX 11–2 JAUNDICE\\nborn; these are hemolytic anemias. As excessive\\nnumbers of RBCs are destroyed, bilirubin is formed\\nat a faster rate than the liver can excrete it. The\\nbilirubin that the liver cannot excrete remains in the\\nblood and causes jaundice. Another name for this\\ntype is hemolytic jaundice.\\nPosthepatic jaundice means that the problem\\nis “after” the liver. The liver excretes bilirubin into\\nbile, which is stored in the gallbladder and then\\nmoved to the small intestine. If the bile ducts are\\nobstructed, perhaps by gallstones or inﬂammation\\nof the gallbladder, bile cannot pass to the small\\nintestine and backs up in the liver. Bilirubin may\\nthen be reabsorbed back into the blood and cause\\njaundice. Another name for this type is obstruc-\\ntive jaundice.\\nJaundice is not a disease, but rather a sign caused\\nby excessive accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.\\nBecause one of the liver’s many functions is the\\nexcretion of bilirubin, jaundice may be a sign of\\nliver disease such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. This may\\nbe called hepatic jaundice, because the problem\\nis with the liver.\\nOther types of jaundice are prehepatic jaundice\\nand posthepatic jaundice: The name of each tells us\\nwhere the problem is. Recall that bilirubin is the\\nwaste product formed from the heme portion of\\nthe hemoglobin of old RBCs. Prehepatic jaun-\\ndice means that the problem is “before” the liver;\\nthat is, hemolysis of RBCs is taking place at a more\\nrapid rate.

For example,\\nlet us say that a type A person needs a transfusion to\\nreplace blood lost in hemorrhage. If this person were\\nto receive type B blood, what would happen? The type\\nA recipient has anti-B antibodies that would bind to\\nthe type B antigens of the RBCs of the donated blood.\\nThe type B RBCs would ﬁrst clump ( agglutination)\\nthen rupture (hemolysis), thus defeating the purpose\\nof the transfusion. An even more serious consequence\\nis that the hemoglobin of the ruptured RBCs, now\\ncalled free hemoglobin, may clog the capillaries of the\\nkidneys and lead to renal damage or renal failure. Y ou\\ncan see why typing and cross-matching of donor and\\nrecipient blood in the hospital laboratory is so impor-\\ntant before any transfusion is given (see Fig. 11–5).\\nThis procedure helps ensure that donated blood will\\nnot bring about a hemolytic transfusion reaction in\\nthe recipient.\\nY ou may have heard of the concept that a person\\nwith type O blood is a “universal donor.” Usually, a\\nunit of type O negative blood may be given to people\\nwith any other blood type. This is so because type O\\nRBCs have neither the A nor the B antigens and will\\nnot react with whatever antibodies the recipient may\\nhave. If only one unit (1 pint) of blood is given, the\\nanti-A and anti-B antibodies in the type O blood\\nplasma will be diluted in the recipient’s blood plasma\\nand will not have a harmful effect on the recipient’s\\nRBCs. The term negative, in O negative, the universal\\ndonor, refers to the Rh factor, which we will now\\nconsider.\\nThe Rh factor is another antigen (often called D)\\nthat may be present on RBCs. People whose RBCs\\nhave the Rh antigen are Rh positive; those without\\nthe antigen are Rh negative. Rh-negative people do\\nnot have natural antibodies to the Rh antigen, and\\nfor them this antigen is foreign. If an Rh-negative\\nperson receives Rh-positive blood by mistake,\\nantibodies will be formed just as they would be\\nto bacteria or viruses. A ﬁrst mistaken transfusion\\noften does not cause problems, because antibody pro-\\nduction is slow upon the ﬁrst exposure to Rh-positive\\nRBCs. A second transfusion, however, when anti-Rh\\nantibodies are already present, will bring about a\\ntransfusion reaction, with hemolysis and possible kid-\\nney damage (see also Box 11–3: Rh Disease of the\\nNewborn).\\nWHITE BLOOD CELLS\\nWhite blood cells (WBCs) are also called leukocytes.\\nThere are ﬁve kinds of WBCs; all are larger than\\nRBCs and have nuclei when mature. The nucleus may\\nbe in one piece or appear as several lobes or segments.\\nSpecial staining for microscopic examination gives\\neach kind of WBC a distinctive appearance (see Figs.\\n11–2 and 11–3).\\nBlood 261\\nBOX 11–3 Rh DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN\\nbaby will be born anemic and jaundiced from the\\nloss of RBCs. Such an infant may require a gradual\\nexchange transfusion to remove the blood with the\\nmaternal antibodies and replace it with Rh-negative\\nblood. The baby will continue to produce its own\\nRh-positive RBCs, which will not be destroyed once\\nthe maternal antibodies have been removed.\\nMuch better than treatment, however, is pre-\\nvention. If an Rh-negative woman delivers an Rh-\\npositive baby, she should be given RhoGAM within\\n72 hours after delivery. RhoGAM is an anti-Rh anti-\\nbody that will destroy any fetal RBCs that have\\nentered the mother’s circulation before her immune\\nsystem can respond and produce antibodies. The\\nRhoGAM antibodies themselves break down within\\na few months. The woman’s next pregnancy will be\\nlike the ﬁrst, as if she had never been exposed to\\nRh-positive RBCs.\\nRh disease of the newborn may also be called\\nerythroblastosis fetalis and is the result of an Rh\\nincompatibility between mother and fetus. During\\na normal pregnancy, maternal blood and fetal\\nblood do not mix in the placenta. However, during\\ndelivery of the placenta (the “afterbirth” that fol-\\nlows the birth of the baby), some fetal blood may\\nenter maternal circulation.\\nIf the woman is Rh negative and her baby is Rh\\npositive, this exposes the woman to Rh-positive\\nRBCs. In response, her immune system will now\\nproduce anti-Rh antibodies following this ﬁrst deliv-\\nery. In a subsequent pregnancy, these maternal\\nantibodies will cross the placenta and enter fetal cir-\\nculation. If this next fetus is also Rh positive, the\\nmaternal antibodies will cause destruction (hemoly-\\nsis) of the fetal RBCs. In severe cases this may result\\nin the death of the fetus.

The granular leukocytes are the neu-\\ntrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, which usually\\nhave nuclei in two or more lobes or segments, and\\nhave distinctly colored granules when stained.\\nNeutrophils have light blue granules, eosinophils have\\nred granules, and basophils have dark blue granules.\\nThe agranular leukocytes are lymphocytes and\\nmonocytes , which have nuclei in one piece.\\nMonocytes are usually quite a bit larger than lympho-\\ncytes. A differential WBC count (part of a CBC) is\\nthe percentage of each kind of leukocyte. Normal\\nranges are listed in T able 11–2, along with other nor-\\nmal values of a CBC.\\nFunctions\\nWhite blood cells all contribute to the same general\\nfunction, which is to protect the body from infectious\\ndisease and to provide immunity to certain diseases.\\nEach kind of leukocyte makes a contribution to this\\nvery important aspect of homeostasis.\\nNeutrophils and monocytes are capable of the\\nphagocytosis of pathogens. Neutrophils are the more\\nabundant phagocytes, but the monocytes are the more\\nefficient phagocytes, because they differentiate into\\nmacrophages, which also phagocytize dead or dam-\\naged tissue at the site of any injury, helping to make\\ntissue repair possible. During an infection, neutrophils\\nare produced more rapidly, and the immature forms,\\ncalled band cells (see Fig. 11–2), may appear in\\ngreater numbers in peripheral circulation (band cells\\nare usually less than 10% of the total neutrophils).\\nThe term “band” refers to the nucleus that has not yet\\nbecome segmented, and may look somewhat like a\\ndumbbell.\\nEosinophils are believed to detoxify foreign\\nproteins and will phagocytize anything labeled with\\nantibodies. This is especially important in allergic\\nreactions and parasitic infections such as trichinosis (a\\nworm parasite). Basophils contain granules of heparin\\nand histamine. Heparin is an anticoagulant that helps\\nprevent abnormal clotting within blood vessels.\\nHistamine, you may recall, is released as part of the\\ninﬂammation process, and it makes capillaries more\\npermeable, allowing tissue ﬂuid, proteins, and white\\nblood cells to accumulate in the damaged area.\\nThere are two major kinds of lymphocytes, T cells\\nand B cells, and a less numerous third kind called nat-\\nural killer cells. For now we will say that T cells (or T\\nlymphocytes) help recognize foreign antigens and may\\ndirectly destroy some foreign antigens. B cells (or B\\nlymphocytes) become plasma cells that produce anti-\\nbodies to foreign antigens. Both T cells and B cells\\nprovide memory for immunity. Natural killer cells\\n(NK cells) destroy foreign cells by chemically ruptur-\\ning their membranes. These functions of lymphocytes\\nare discussed in the context of the mechanisms of\\nimmunity in Chapter 14.\\nAs mentioned earlier, leukocytes function in tissue\\nﬂuid as well as in the blood. Many WBCs are capable\\nof self-locomotion (ameboid movement) and are able\\nto squeeze between the cells of capillary walls and out\\ninto tissue spaces.

T wo of these mech-\\nanisms are shown in Fig. 11–6.\\n1. Vascular spasm—when a large vessel such as an\\nartery or vein is severed, the smooth muscle in its\\nwall contracts in response to the damage (called the\\nmyogenic response). Platelets in the area of the\\nrupture release serotonin, which also brings about\\nvasoconstriction. The diameter of the vessel is\\nthereby made smaller, and the smaller opening may\\nthen be blocked by a blood clot. If the vessel did\\nnot constrict ﬁrst, the clot that forms would quickly\\nbe washed out by the force of the blood pressure.\\n2.

No, they are too small, and though\\nthey do form, they are washed away (until a clot\\nbegins to form that can contain them). Would vas-\\ncular spasm be effective for capillaries?

If even one HLA type matches, the chance\\nof rejection is lessened. Although all transplant\\nrecipients (except corneal) must receive immuno-\\nsuppressive medications to prevent rejection, such\\nmedications make them more susceptible to infec-\\ntion. The closer the HLA match of the donated\\norgan, the lower the dosage of such medications,\\nand the less chance of serious infections. (The\\nchance of ﬁnding a perfect HLA match in the gen-\\neral population is estimated at 1 in 20,000.)\\nThere is yet another aspect of the importance of\\nHLA: People with certain HLA types seem to be\\nmore likely to develop certain non-infectious dis-\\neases. For example, type 1 (insulin-dependent) dia-\\nbetes mellitus is often found in people with HLA\\nDR3 or DR4, and a form of arthritis of the spine\\ncalled ankylosing spondylitis is often found in those\\nwith HLA B27. These are not genes for these dis-\\neases, but may be predisposing factors. What may\\nhappen is this: A virus enters the body and stimu-\\nlates the immune system to produce antibodies.\\nThe virus is destroyed, but one of the person’s own\\nantigens is so similar to the viral antigen that the\\nimmune system continues its activity and begins to\\ndestroy this similar part of the body. Another possi-\\nbility is that a virus damages a self-antigen to the\\nextent that it is now so different that it will be per-\\nceived as foreign. These are two theories of how\\nautoimmune diseases are triggered, which is the\\nfocus of much research in the ﬁeld of immunology.\\nHuman leukocyte antigens (HLA) are antigens\\non WBCs that are representative of the antigens\\npresent on all the cells of an individual. These are\\nour “self” antigens that identify cells that belong in\\nthe body.\\nRecall that in the ABO blood group of RBCs,\\nthere are only two antigens, A and B, and four\\npossible types: A, B, AB, and O. HLA antigens are\\nalso given letter names. HLA A, B, and C are called\\nclass I proteins, with from 100 to more than 400\\npossibilities for the speciﬁc protein each can be. The\\nseveral class II proteins are given various D designa-\\ntions and, again, there are many possibilities for\\neach. Each person has two genes for each HLA type,\\nbecause these types are inherited, just as RBC types\\nare inherited. Members of the same family may\\nhave some of the same HLA types, and identical\\ntwins have exactly the same HLA types.\\nThe purpose of the HLA types is to provide a\\n“self” comparison for the immune system to use\\nwhen pathogens enter the body. The T lympho-\\ncytes compare the “self” antigens on macrophages\\nto the antigens on bacteria and viruses. Because\\nthese antigens do not match ours, they are recog-\\nnized as foreign; this is the ﬁrst step in the destruc-\\ntion of a pathogen.\\nThe surgical transplantation of organs has also\\nfocused on the HLA. The most serious problem for\\nthe recipient of a transplanted heart or kidney is\\nrejection of the organ and its destruction by the\\nimmune system. You may be familiar with the term\\ntissue typing. This process involves determining\\n11Scanlon(p3)-ch11  8/17/06  10:52 AM  Page 264'),\n",

Clots do not usually\\nform in intact vessels because the endothelium (sim-\\nple squamous epithelial lining) is very smooth and\\nrepels the platelets and clotting factors. If the lining\\nbecomes roughened, as happens with the lipid depo-\\nsits of atherosclerosis, a clot will form.\\nHeparin, produced by basophils, is a natural antico-\\nagulant that inhibits the clotting process (although\\nheparin is called a “blood thinner,” it does not “thin”\\nor dilute the blood in any way; rather it prevents a\\nchemical reaction from taking place). The liver pro-\\nduces a globulin called antithrombin, which combines\\nwith and inactivates excess thrombin. Excess thrombin\\nwould exert a positive feedback effect on the clotting\\ncascade, and result in the splitting of more prothrom-\\nbin to thrombin, more clotting, more thrombin\\nformed, and so on. Antithrombin helps to prevent this,\\nas does the ﬁbrin of the clot, which adsorbs excess\\nthrombin and renders it inactive. All of these factors\\nare the external brake for this positive feedback mech-\\nanism. T ogether they usually limit the ﬁbrin formed to\\nwhat is needed to create a useful clot but not an\\nobstructive one.\\nThrombosis refers to clotting in an intact vessel;\\nthe clot itself is called a thrombus. Coronary throm-\\nbosis, for example, is abnormal clotting in a coronary\\nartery, which will decrease the blood (oxygen) supply\\nto part of the heart muscle. An embolism is a clot\\nor other tissue transported from elsewhere that lodges\\nin and obstructs a vessel (see Box 11–7: Dissolving\\nClots).\\nSUMMARY\\nAll of the functions of blood described in this chap-\\nter—transport, regulation, and protection—contri-\\nbute to the homeostasis of the body as a whole.\\nHowever, these functions could not be carried out if\\nthe blood did not circulate properly. The circulation\\nof blood throughout the blood vessels depends upon\\nthe proper functioning of the heart, the pump of the\\ncirculatory system, which is the subject of our next\\nchapter.\\n268 Blood\\nBOX 11–7 DISSOLVING CLOTS\\nAbnormal clots may cause serious problems in\\ncoronary arteries, pulmonary arteries, cerebral\\nvessels, and even veins in the legs. However, if\\nclots can be dissolved before they cause death of\\ntissue, normal circulation and tissue functioning\\nmay be restored.\\nOne of the ﬁrst substances used to dissolve\\nclots in coronary arteries was streptokinase,\\nwhich is actually a bacterial toxin produced\\nby some members of the genus Streptococcus.\\nStreptokinase did indeed dissolve clots, but its\\nuse created the possibility of clot destruction\\nthroughout the body, with serious hemorrhage a\\npotential consequence.\\nSafer chemicals called third-generation\\nthrombolytics are now used (thrombo /H11005“clot”\\nand lytic /H11005“to lyse” or “split”). In a case of coro-\\nnary thrombosis, if a thrombolytic can be admin-\\nistered within a few hours, the clot may be\\ndissolved and permanent heart damage pre-\\nvented. The same procedure is also used to pre-\\nvent permanent brain damage after strokes\\n(CVAs) caused by blood clots.\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nThe general functions of blood are trans-\\nportation, regulation, and protection.\\nCharacteristics of Blood\\n1.

Formed elements are RBCs, WBCs, and platelets\\n(Figs. 11–2 and 11–3).\\n2. After birth the primary hemopoietic tissue is the\\nred bone marrow, which contains stem cells.\\nLymphocytes mature and divide in the lymphatic\\ntissue of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus,\\nwhich also have stem cells for lymphocytes.\\nRed Blood Cells—erythrocytes (see Table\\n11–2 for normal values)\\n1. Biconcave discs; no nuclei when mature.\\n2. RBCs carry O\\n2 bonded to the iron in hemoglobin.\\n3. RBCs are formed in the RBM from hemocytoblasts\\n(stem cells, the precursor cells).\\n4. Hypoxia stimulates the kidneys to produce the hor-\\nmone erythropoietin, which increases the rate of\\nRBC production in the RBM.\\n5. Immature RBCs: normoblasts (have nuclei) and\\nreticulocytes; large numbers in peripheral cir-\\nculation indicate a need for more RBCs to carry\\noxygen.\\n6. Vitamin B\\n12 is the extrinsic factor, needed for DNA\\nsynthesis (mitosis) in stem cells in the RBM.\\nIntrinsic factor is produced by the parietal cells of\\nthe stomach lining; it combines with B\\n12 to prevent\\nits digestion and promote its absorption.\\n7. RBCs live for 120 days and are then phagocytized\\nby macrophages in the liver, spleen, and RBM. The\\niron is returned to the RBM or stored in the liver.\\nThe heme of the hemoglobin is converted to biliru-\\nbin, which the liver excretes into bile to be elimi-\\nnated in feces. Colon bacteria change bilirubin to\\nurobilinogen. Any urobilinogen absorbed is con-\\nverted to urobilin and excreted by the kidneys in\\nurine (Fig. 11–4). Jaundice is the accumulation of\\nbilirubin in the blood, perhaps due to liver disease.\\n8. ABO blood types are hereditary. The type indicates\\nthe antigen(s) on the RBCs (see T able 11–1 and\\nFig. 11–5); antibodies in plasma are for those anti-\\ngens not present on the RBCs and are important\\nfor transfusions.\\n9. The Rh type is also hereditary. Rh positive means\\nthat the D antigen is present on the RBCs; Rh neg-\\native means that the D antigen is not present on the\\nRBCs. Rh-negative people do not have natural\\nantibodies but will produce them if given Rh-\\npositive blood.\\nWhite Blood Cells—leukocytes (see Table\\n11–2 for normal values)\\n1. Larger than RBCs; have nuclei when mature; pro-\\nduced in the red bone marrow, except some lym-\\nphocytes produced in the thymus (Figs. 11–2 and\\n11–3).\\n2. Granular WBCs are the neutrophils, eosinophils,\\nand basophils.\\n3. Agranular WBCs are the lymphocytes and mono-\\ncytes.\\n4. Neutrophils and monocytes phagocytize patho-\\ngens; monocytes become macrophages, which also\\nphagocytize dead tissue.\\n5. Eosinophils detoxify foreign proteins during aller-\\ngic reactions and parasitic infections; they phago-\\ncytize anything labeled with antibodies.\\n6. Basophils contain the anticoagulant heparin and\\nhistamine, which contributes to inﬂammation.\\n7. Lymphocytes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer\\ncells. T cells recognize foreign antigens and des-\\ntroy them. B cells become plasma cells, which pro-\\nduce antibodies to foreign antigens. NK cells\\ndestroy foreign cell membranes.\\n8. WBCs carry out their functions in tissue ﬂuid and\\nlymphatic tissue, as well as in the blood.\\nPlatelets—thrombocytes (see Table 11–2 for\\nnormal values)\\n1. Platelets are formed in the RBM and are fragments\\nof megakaryocytes; the hormone thrombopoietin\\nfrom the liver increases platelet production.\\n2. Platelets are involved in all mechanisms of hemo-\\nstasis (prevention of blood loss) (Fig. 11–6).\\n3. Vascular spasm—large vessels constrict when\\ndamaged, the myogenic response.

Imagine trying to\\nsqueeze a tennis ball 70 times a minute. After a few\\nminutes, your arm muscles would begin to tire. Then\\nimagine increasing your squeezing rate to 120 times a\\nminute. Most of us could not keep that up very long,\\nbut that is what the heart does during exercise. A\\nhealthy heart can increase its rate and force of con-\\ntraction to meet the body’s need for more oxygen,\\nthen return to its resting rate and keep on beating as if\\nnothing very extraordinary had happened. In fact, it\\nisn’t extraordinary at all; this is the job the heart is\\nmeant to do.\\nThe primary function of the heart is to pump blood\\nthrough the arteries, capillaries, and veins. As you\\nlearned in the previous chapter, blood transports oxy-\\ngen and nutrients and has other important functions\\nas well. The heart is the pump that keeps blood circu-\\nlating properly.\\nLOCATION AND\\nPERICARDIAL MEMBRANES\\nThe heart is located in the thoracic cavity between the\\nlungs. This area is called the mediastinum. The base\\nof the cone-shaped heart is uppermost, behind the\\nsternum, and the great vessels enter or leave here. The\\napex (tip) of the heart points downward and is just\\nabove the diaphragm to the left of the midline. This is\\nwhy we may think of the heart as being on the left\\nside, because the strongest beat can be heard or felt\\nhere.\\nThe heart is enclosed in the pericardial mem-\\nbranes, of which there are three layers (Fig. 12–1).\\nThe outermost is the ﬁbrous pericardium, a loose-\\nﬁtting sac of strong ﬁbrous connective tissue that\\nextends inferiorly over the diaphragm and superiorly\\nover the bases of the large vessels that enter and leave\\nthe heart. The serous pericardium is a folded mem-\\nbrane; the fold gives it two layers, parietal and visceral.\\nLining the ﬁbrous pericardium is the parietal peri-\\ncardium. On the surface of the heart muscle is the\\nvisceral pericardium , often called the epicardium.\\nBetween the parietal and visceral pericardial mem-\\nbranes is serous ﬂuid, which prevents friction as the\\nheart beats.\\nCHAMBERS—VESSELS AND VALVES\\nThe walls of the four chambers of the heart are made\\nof cardiac muscle called the myocardium. The cham-\\nbers are lined with endocardium, simple squamous\\nepithelium that also covers the valves of the heart and\\ncontinues into the vessels as their lining (endothe-\\nlium). The important physical characteristic of the\\nendocardium is not its thinness, but rather its smooth-\\nness. This very smooth tissue prevents abnormal\\nblood clotting, because clotting would be initiated by\\ncontact of blood with a rough surface.\\n274 The Heart\\nEndocardium\\nParietal\\npericardiumMyocardium\\n(heart muscle)\\nEpicardium\\n(visceral pericardium)\\nFibrous pericardium\\n(pericardial sac)\\nPericardial cavity\\nFigure 12–1.

The lower cham-\\nbers are the right and left ventricles, which have\\nthicker walls and are separated by the interventricu-\\nlar septum (Fig. 12–2). As you will see, the atria\\nreceive blood, either from the body or the lungs, and\\nthe ventricles pump blood to either the lungs or the\\nbody.\\nRIGHT ATRIUM\\nThe two large caval veins return blood from the body\\nto the right atrium (see Fig. 12–2). The superior vena\\ncava carries blood from the upper body, and the infe-\\nrior vena cava carries blood from the lower body.\\nFrom the right atrium, blood will ﬂow through the\\nright atrioventricular (AV) valve, or tricuspid valve,\\ninto the right ventricle.\\nThe tricuspid valve is made of three ﬂaps (or cusps)\\nof endocardium reinforced with connective tissue. The\\ngeneral purpose of all valves in the circulatory system\\nis to prevent backﬂow of blood. The speciﬁc purpose\\nof the tricuspid valve is to prevent backﬂow of blood\\nfrom the right ventricle to the right atrium when the\\nright ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts,\\nblood is forced behind the three valve ﬂaps, forcing\\nthem upward and together to close the valve.\\nLEFT ATRIUM\\nThe left atrium receives blood from the lungs, by way\\nof four pulmonary veins. This blood will then ﬂow\\ninto the left ventricle through the left atrioventricular\\n(AV) valve, also called the mitral valve or bicuspid\\n(two ﬂaps) valve. The mitral valve prevents backﬂow\\nof blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium when\\nthe left ventricle contracts.\\nAnother function of the atria is the production of a\\nhormone involved in blood pressure maintenance.\\nWhen the walls of the atria are stretched by increased\\nblood volume or blood pressure, the cells produce\\natrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) , also called atrial\\nnatriuretic hormone (ANH). (The ventricles of the\\nheart produce a similar hormone called B-type natri-\\nuretic peptide, or BNP , but we will use ANP as the\\nrepresentative cardiac hormone.) ANP decreases the\\nreabsorption of sodium ions by the kidneys, so that\\nmore sodium ions are excreted in urine, which in turn\\nincreases the elimination of water. The loss of water\\nlowers blood volume and blood pressure. Y ou may\\nhave noticed that ANP is an antagonist to the hor-\\nmone aldosterone, which raises blood pressure.\\nRIGHT VENTRICLE\\nWhen the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve\\ncloses and the blood is pumped to the lungs through\\nthe pulmonary artery (or trunk). At the junction of this\\nlarge artery and the right ventricle is the pulmonary\\nsemilunar valve (or more simply, pulmonary valve).\\nIts three ﬂaps are forced open when the right ventri-\\ncle contracts and pumps blood into the pulmonary\\nartery. When the right ventricle relaxes, blood tends\\nto come back, but this ﬁlls the valve ﬂaps and closes\\nthe pulmonary valve to prevent backﬂow of blood into\\nthe right ventricle.\\nProjecting into the lower part of the right ventricle\\nare columns of myocardium called papillary muscles\\n(see Fig. 12–2). Strands of ﬁbrous connective tissue,\\nthe chordae tendineae , extend from the papillary\\nmuscles to the ﬂaps of the tricuspid valve. When the\\nright ventricle contracts, the papillary muscles also\\ncontract and pull on the chordae tendineae to prevent\\ninversion of the tricuspid valve. If you have ever had\\nyour umbrella blown inside out by a strong wind, you\\ncan see what would happen if the ﬂaps of the tricuspid\\nvalve were not anchored by the chordae tendineae and\\npapillary muscles.\\nLEFT VENTRICLE\\nThe walls of the left ventricle are thicker than those of\\nthe right ventricle, which enables the left ventricle to\\ncontract more forcefully. The left ventricle pumps\\nblood to the body through the aorta, the largest artery\\nof the body. At the junction of the aorta and the left\\nventricle is the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic\\nvalve) (see Fig. 12–2). This valve is opened by the\\nforce of contraction of the left ventricle, which also\\ncloses the mitral valve. The aortic valve closes when\\nthe left ventricle relaxes, to prevent backﬂow of blood\\nfrom the aorta to the left ventricle. When the mitral\\n(left AV) valve closes, it prevents backﬂow of blood to\\nthe left atrium; the ﬂaps of the mitral valve are also\\nanchored by chordae tendineae and papillary muscles.\\nAll of the valves are shown in Fig. 12–3, which also\\ndepicts the ﬁbrous skeleton of the heart .

If a coro-\\nnary artery becomes obstructed, by a blood clot for\\nexample, part of the myocardium becomes ischemic,\\nthat is, deprived of its blood supply. Prolonged\\nischemia will create an infarct, an area of necrotic\\n(dead) tissue. This is a myocardial infarction, com-\\nmonly called a heart attack (see also Box 12–1: Coro-\\nnary Artery Disease).\\nCARDIAC CYCLE\\nAND HEART SOUNDS\\nThe cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in one\\nheartbeat. In its simplest form, the cardiac cycle is the\\nsimultaneous contraction of the two atria, followed a\\nfraction of a second later by the simultaneous contrac-\\ntion of the two ventricles. Systole is another term for\\ncontraction. The term for relaxation is diastole. Y ou\\nare probably familiar with these terms as they apply to\\nblood pressure readings. If we apply them to the car-\\ndiac cycle, we can say that atrial systole is followed by\\nventricular systole. There is, however, a signiﬁcant\\ndifference between the movement of blood from the\\natria to the ventricles and the movement of blood\\nfrom the ventricles to the arteries. The events of the\\ncardiac cycle are shown in Fig. 12–5. In this traditional\\nrepresentation, the cardiac cycle is depicted in a circle,\\nbecause one heartbeat follows another, and the begin-\\nning of atrial systole is at the top (12 o’clock). The size\\nof the segment or arc of the circle indicates how long\\nit takes. Find the segment for atrial systole and the one\\nfor ventricular systole, and notice how much larger\\n(meaning “longer”) ventricular systole is. Do you\\nthink this might mean that ventricular contraction is\\nmore important than atrial contraction? It does, as you\\nwill see. Refer to Fig. 12–5 as you read the following.\\nWe will begin at the bottom (6 o’clock) where the atria\\nare in the midst of diastole and the ventricles have just\\ncompleted their systole. The entire heart is relaxed\\nand the atria are ﬁlling with blood.\\nBlood is constantly ﬂowing from the veins into\\nboth atria. As more blood accumulates, its pressure\\nforces open the right and left AV valves. T wo-thirds\\nof the atrial blood ﬂows passively into the ventri-\\ncles (which brings us to 12 o’clock); the atria then\\ncontract to pump the remaining blood into the ven-\\ntricles.\\nFollowing their contraction, the atria relax and the\\nventricles begin to contract. Ventricular contraction\\nforces blood against the ﬂaps of the right and left AV\\nvalves and closes them; the force of blood also opens\\nthe aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves. As the\\nventricles continue to contract, they pump blood into\\nthe arteries. Notice that blood that enters the arteries\\nmust all be pumped. The ventricles then relax, and at\\nthe same time blood continues to ﬂow into the atria,\\nand the cycle begins again.\\n278 The Heart\\nAorta\\nLeft coronary artery\\nAnterior\\ninterventricular branch\\nGreat cardiac\\nvein\\nCoronary sinus\\nPosterior\\nartery and\\nvein\\nSmall\\ncardiac veinRight coronary artery\\nand vein\\nA B\\nFigure 12–4.

See text for description.\\nQUESTION: What makes the AV valves\\nclose and the semilunar valves open?\\nThe important distinction here is that most blood\\nﬂows passively from atria to ventricles, but all blood\\nto the arteries is actively pumped by the ventricles.\\nFor this reason, the proper functioning of the ventri-\\ncles is much more crucial to survival than is atrial\\nfunctioning.\\nY ou may be asking “All this in one heartbeat?” The\\nanswer is yes. The cardiac cycle is this precise\\nsequence of events that keeps blood moving from the\\nveins, through the heart, and into the arteries.\\nThe cardiac cycle also creates the heart sounds :\\nEach heartbeat produces two sounds, often called lub-\\ndup, that can be heard with a stethoscope. The ﬁrst\\nsound, the loudest and longest, is caused by ventricu-\\nlar systole closing the AV valves. The second sound is\\ncaused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary\\nsemilunar valves. If any of the valves do not close\\nproperly, an extra sound called a heart murmur may\\nbe heard (see Box 12–2: Heart Murmur).\\nCARDIAC CONDUCTION PATHWAY\\nThe cardiac cycle is a sequence of mechanical events\\nthat is regulated by the electrical activity of the\\nmyocardium. Cardiac muscle cells have the ability\\nto contract spontaneously; that is, nerve impulses are\\nnot required to cause contraction. The heart generates\\nits own beat, and the electrical impulses follow a\\nvery speciﬁc route throughout the myocardium. Y ou\\nmay ﬁnd it helpful to refer to Fig. 12–6 as you read the\\nfollowing.\\nThe natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinoatrial\\n(SA) node, a specialized group of cardiac muscle cells\\nlocated in the wall of the right atrium just below the\\nopening of the superior vena cava. The SA node is\\nconsidered specialized because it has the most rapid\\nrate of contraction, that is, it depolarizes more rapidly\\nthan any other part of the myocardium (60 to 80 times\\nper minute). As you may recall, depolarization is the\\nrapid entry of Na\\n/H11001ions and the reversal of charges on\\neither side of the cell membrane. The cells of the SA\\nnode are more permeable to Na\\n/H11001ions than are other\\ncardiac muscle cells. Therefore, they depolarize more\\nrapidly, then contract and initiate each heartbeat.\\nFrom the SA node, impulses for contraction travel\\nto the atrioventricular (AV) node , located in the\\nlower interatrial septum. The transmission of impulses\\nfrom the SA node to the AV node and to the rest of the\\natrial myocardium brings about atrial systole.\\n12Scanlon(p3)-ch12  8/17/06  10:53 AM  Page 279'),\n",

Any one of these may cause\\ndamage to the lining of coronary arteries, which is\\nthe ﬁrst step in the abnormal deposition of choles-\\nterol. A diet high in cholesterol and saturated fats\\nand high blood levels of these lipids will increase\\nthe rate of cholesterol deposition.\\nA possible chemical marker of risk is a high blood\\nlevel of homocysteine. Homocysteine is a metabolic\\nproduct of the essential amino acid methionine,\\nand may be converted back to methionine or fur-\\nther changed and excreted by the kidneys. A high\\nblood level of homocysteine may indicate inﬂam-\\nmation of the walls of arteries. Yet another chemical\\nmarker of inﬂammation is C-reactive protein (CRP).\\nThere is still much to learn about the role of inﬂam-\\nmation in atherosclerosis, but simple blood tests for\\nchemical markers may someday provide a diagnosis\\nbefore heart damage occurs.\\nWhen coronary artery disease becomes life-\\nthreatening, coronary artery bypass surgery may be\\nperformed. In this procedure, a synthetic vessel or a\\nvein (such as the saphenous vein of the leg) is\\ngrafted around the obstructed coronary vessel to\\nrestore blood ﬂow to the myocardium. This is not a\\ncure, for atherosclerosis may occur in a grafted vein\\nor at other sites in the coronary arteries.\\nCoronary artery disease results in decreased blood\\nﬂow to the myocardium. If blood ﬂow is diminished\\nbut not completely obstructed, the person may\\nexperience difficulty breathing and angina, which is\\nchest pain caused by lack of oxygen to part of the\\nheart muscle. If blood ﬂow is completely blocked,\\nhowever, the result is a myocardial infarction\\n(necrosis of cardiac muscle).\\nThe most common cause of coronary artery dis-\\nease is atherosclerosis. Plaques of cholesterol form\\nin the walls of a coronary artery; this narrows the\\nlumen (cavity) and creates a rough surface where a\\nclot (thrombus) may form (see Box Fig. 12–A). A\\npredisposing factor for such clot formation, one that\\ncannot be changed, is a family history of coronary\\nartery disease. There is no “gene for heart attacks,”\\nbut we do have genes for the enzymes involved in\\ncholesterol metabolism. Many of these are liver\\nenzymes that regulate the transport of cholesterol in\\nthe blood in the form of lipoproteins and regulate\\nthe liver’s excretion of excess cholesterol in bile.\\nSome people, therefore, have a greater tendency\\nthan others to have higher blood levels of choles-\\nterol and certain lipoproteins. In women before\\nmenopause, estrogen is believed to exert a protec-\\ntive effect by lowering blood lipid levels. This is why\\nheart attacks in the 30- to 50-year-old age range are\\nless frequent in women than in men.\\nNormal artery Atherosclerotic artery\\nA B\\nBox Figure 12–A (A) Cross-section of normal coronary artery.

(The SA node actually has a\\nslightly faster rate, closer to 100 beats per minute, but\\nis slowed by parasympathetic nerve impulses to what\\nwe consider a normal resting rate.) A rate less than 60\\n(except for athletes) is called bradycardia; a prolonged\\nor consistent rate greater than 100 beats per minute is\\ncalled tachycardia.\\nA child’s normal heart rate may be as high as 100\\nbeats per minute, that of an infant as high as 120, and\\nthat of a near-term fetus as high as 140 beats per\\nminute. These higher rates are not related to age, but\\nrather to size: the smaller the individual, the higher the\\nmetabolic rate and the faster the heart rate. Parallels\\nmay be found among animals of different sizes; the\\nheart rate of a mouse is about 200 beats per minute\\nand that of an elephant about 30 beats per minute.\\nLet us return to the adult heart rate and consider\\nthe person who is in excellent physical condition. As\\nyou may know, well-conditioned athletes have low\\nresting pulse rates. Those of basketball players are\\noften around 50 beats per minute, and the pulse of a\\nmarathon runner often ranges from 35 to 40 beats per\\nminute. T o understand why this is so, remember that\\nthe heart is a muscle. When our skeletal muscles are\\nexercised, they become stronger and more efficient.\\nThe same is true for the heart; consistent exercise\\nmakes it a more efficient pump, as you will see in the\\nnext section.\\nCARDIAC OUTPUT\\nCardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by a\\nventricle in 1 minute. A certain level of cardiac output\\nis needed at all times to transport oxygen to tissues and\\nto remove waste products. During exercise, cardiac\\noutput must increase to meet the body’s need for more\\noxygen. We will return to exercise after ﬁrst consider-\\ning resting cardiac output.\\nT o calculate cardiac output, we must know the\\npulse rate and how much blood is pumped per beat.\\nStroke volume is the term for the amount of blood\\npumped by a ventricle per beat; an average resting\\nstroke volume is 60 to 80 mL per beat. A simple for-\\nmula then enables us to determine cardiac output:\\nCardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse (heart rate)\\nLet us put into this formula an average resting\\nstroke volume, 70 mL, and an average resting pulse,\\n70 beats per minute (bpm):\\nCardiac output /H1100570 mL /H1100370 bpm\\nCardiac output /H110054900 mL per minute\\n(approximately 5 liters)\\nNaturally, cardiac output varies with the size of the\\nperson, but the average resting cardiac output is 5 to 6\\nliters per minute. Notice that this amount is just about\\nthe same as a person’s average volume of blood. At\\nrest, the heart pumps all of the blood in the body\\nwithin about a minute. Changes are possible, depend-\\ning on circumstances and extent of physical activity.\\nIf we now reconsider the athlete, you will be able to\\nsee precisely why the athlete has a low resting pulse. In\\nour formula, we will use an average resting cardiac\\noutput (5 liters) and an athlete’s pulse rate (50):\\nCardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse\\n5000 mL /H11005stroke volume /H1100350 bpm\\n5000/50 /H11005stroke volume\\n100 mL /H11005stroke volume\\nNotice that the athlete’s resting stroke volume is\\nsigniﬁcantly higher than the average. The athlete’s\\nmore efficient heart pumps more blood with each beat\\nand so can maintain a normal resting cardiac output\\nwith fewer beats.\\nNow let us see how the heart responds to exercise.\\nHeart rate (pulse) increases during exercise, and so\\ndoes stroke volume. The increase in stroke volume is\\nthe result of Starling’s law of the heart, which states\\nthat the more the cardiac muscle ﬁbers are stretched,\\nthe more forcefully they contract. During exercise,\\nmore blood returns to the heart; this is called venous\\nreturn. Increased venous return stretches the myocar-\\ndium of the ventricles, which contract more forcefully\\nand pump more blood, thereby increasing stroke vol-\\nume. Therefore, during exercise, our formula might\\nbe the following:\\nCardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse\\nCardiac output /H11005100 mL /H11003100 bpm\\nCardiac output /H1100510,000 mL (10 liters)\\nThe Heart 283\\n12Scanlon(p3)-ch12  8/17/06  10:53 AM  Page 283'),\n",

The cardiac output of a healthy\\nyoung person may increase up to four times the rest-\\ning level during strenuous exercise. This difference is\\nthe cardiac reserve, the extra volume the heart can\\npump when necessary. If resting cardiac output is 5\\nliters and exercise cardiac output is 20 liters, the car-\\ndiac reserve is 15 liters. The marathon runner’s cardiac\\noutput may increase six times or more compared to\\nthe resting level, and cardiac reserve is even greater\\nthan for the average young person; this is the result of\\nthe marathoner’s extremely efficient heart.

A ventricle does not empty\\ncompletely when it contracts, but should pump out\\n60% to 70% of the blood within it. A lower percent-\\nage would indicate that the ventricle is weakening.\\nThese aspects of physiology are summarized in T able\\n12–2.\\nREGULATION OF HEART RATE\\nAlthough the heart generates and maintains its own\\nbeat, the rate of contraction can be changed to adapt\\nto different situations. The nervous system can and\\ndoes bring about necessary changes in heart rate as\\nwell as in force of contraction.\\nThe medulla of the brain contains the two cardiac\\ncenters, the accelerator center and the inhibitory\\ncenter. These centers send impulses to the heart\\nalong autonomic nerves. Recall from Chapter 8 that\\nthe autonomic nervous system has two divisions: sym-\\npathetic and parasympathetic. Sympathetic impulses\\nfrom the accelerator center along sympathetic nerves\\nincrease heart rate and force of contraction during\\nexercise and stressful situations. Parasympathetic\\nimpulses from the inhibitory center along the vagus\\nnerves decrease the heart rate. At rest these impulses\\nslow down the depolarization of the SA node to what\\nwe consider a normal resting rate, and they also slow\\nthe heart after exercise is over.\\nOur next question might be: What information is\\nreceived by the medulla to initiate changes? Because\\nthe heart pumps blood, it is essential to maintain nor-\\nmal blood pressure. Blood contains oxygen, which all\\ntissues must receive continuously. Therefore, changes\\nin blood pressure and oxygen level of the blood are\\nstimuli for changes in heart rate.\\nY ou may also recall from Chapter 9 that presso-\\nreceptors and chemoreceptors are located in the\\ncarotid arteries and aortic arch. Pressoreceptors in\\nthe carotid sinuses and aortic sinus detect changes in\\nblood pressure. Chemoreceptors in the carotid\\nbodies and aortic body detect changes in the oxygen\\ncontent of the blood.

The health of the myocardium\\ndepends on its blood supply, and with age there is\\ngreater likelihood that atherosclerosis will narrow the\\ncoronary arteries. Atherosclerosis is the deposition of\\ncholesterol on and in the walls of the arteries, which\\ndecreases blood ﬂow and forms rough surfaces that\\nmay cause intravascular clot formation.\\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) causes the left\\nventricle to work harder; it may enlarge and outgrow\\nits blood supply, thus becoming weaker. A weak ven-\\ntricle is not an efficient pump, and such weakness may\\nprogress to congestive heart failure; such a progres-\\nsion may be slow, or may be rapid. The heart valves\\nmay become thickened by ﬁbrosis, leading to heart\\nmurmurs and less efficient pumping. Arrhythmias are\\nalso more common with age, as the cells of the con-\\nduction pathway become less efficient.\\nSUMMARY\\nAs you can see, the nervous system regulates the func-\\ntioning of the heart based on what the heart is sup-\\nposed to do.

Before that time, it\\nwas believed that blood was static or stationary, some\\nof it within the vessels but the rest sort of in puddles\\nthroughout the body. Harvey showed that blood\\nindeed does move, and only in the blood vessels\\n(though he did not know of the existence of capillar-\\nies). In the centuries that followed, the active (rather\\nthan merely passive) roles of the vascular system were\\ndiscovered, and all contribute to homeostasis.\\nThe vascular system consists of the arteries, capil-\\nlaries, and veins through which the heart pumps blood\\nthroughout the body. As you will see, the major “busi-\\nness” of the vascular system, which is the exchange of\\nmaterials between the blood and tissues, takes place in\\nthe capillaries. The arteries and veins, however, are\\njust as important, transporting blood between the cap-\\nillaries and the heart.\\nAnother important topic of this chapter will be\\nblood pressure (BP), which is the force the blood\\nexerts against the walls of the vessels. Normal blood\\npressure is essential for circulation and for some of the\\nmaterial exchanges that take place in capillaries.\\nARTERIES\\nArteries carry blood from the heart to capillaries;\\nsmaller arteries are called arterioles. If we look at an\\nartery in cross-section, we ﬁnd three layers (or tunics)\\nof tissues, each with different functions (Fig. 13–1).\\nThe innermost layer, the tunica intima, is the only\\npart of a vessel that is in contact with blood. It is made\\nof simple squamous epithelium called endothelium.\\nThis lining is the same type of tissue that forms the\\nendocardium, the lining of the chambers of the heart.\\nAs you might guess, its function is also the same: Its\\nextreme smoothness prevents abnormal blood clot-\\nting. The endothelium of vessels, however, also pro-\\nduces nitric oxide (NO), which is a vasodilator. The\\ntunica media , or middle layer, is made of smooth\\nmuscle and elastic connective tissue. Both of these tis-\\nsues are involved in the maintenance of normal blood\\npressure, especially diastolic blood pressure when the\\nheart is relaxed. The smooth muscle is the tissue\\naffected by the vasodilator NO; relaxation of this mus-\\ncle tissue brings about dilation of the vessel. Smooth\\nmuscle also has a nerve supply; sympathetic nerve\\nimpulses bring about vasoconstriction. Fibrous con-\\nnective tissue forms the outer layer, the tunica\\nexterna. This tissue is very strong, which is important\\nto prevent the rupture or bursting of the larger arter-\\nies that carry blood under high pressure (see Box 13–1:\\nDisorders of Arteries).\\nThe outer and middle layers of large arteries are\\nquite thick. In the smallest arterioles, only individual\\nsmooth muscle cells encircle the tunica intima. As\\nmentioned, the smooth muscle layer enables arteries\\nto constrict or dilate. Such changes in diameter are\\nregulated by the medulla and autonomic nervous sys-\\ntem, and will be discussed in a later section on blood\\npressure.\\nVEINS\\nVeins carry blood from capillaries back to the heart;\\nthe smaller veins are called venules. The same three\\ntissue layers are present in veins as in the walls of\\narteries, but there are some differences when com-\\npared to the arterial layers. The inner layer of veins is\\nsmooth endothelium, but at intervals this lining is\\nfolded to form valves (see Fig. 13–1). Valves prevent\\nbackﬂow of blood and are most numerous in veins of\\nthe legs, where blood must often return to the heart\\nagainst the force of gravity.\\nThe middle layer of veins is a thin layer of smooth\\nmuscle. It is thin because veins do not regulate blood\\npressure and blood ﬂow into capillaries as arteries do.\\nVeins can constrict extensively, however, and this\\nfunction becomes very important in certain situations\\nsuch as severe hemorrhage. The outer layer of veins is\\nalso thin; not as much ﬁbrous connective tissue is nec-\\nessary because blood pressure in veins is very low.\\nANASTOMOSES\\nAn anastomosis is a connection, or joining, of vessels,\\nthat is, artery to artery or vein to vein. The general\\npurpose of these connections is to provide alternate\\npathways for the ﬂow of blood if one vessel becomes\\nobstructed.\\nAn arterial anastomosis helps ensure that blood\\nwill get to the capillaries of an organ to deliver oxygen\\n292 The Vascular System\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 292'),\n",

Rupture of a cerebral\\naneurysm is a possible cause of a cerebrovascular\\naccident (CVA). Rupture of an aortic aneurysm is\\nlife-threatening and requires immediate corrective\\nsurgery. The damaged portion of the artery is\\nremoved and replaced with a graft. Such surgery\\nmay also be performed when an aneurysm is found\\nbefore it ruptures.\\nAtherosclerosis—this condition has been men-\\ntioned previously; see Chapters 2 and 12.\\nArteriosclerosis —although commonly called\\n“hardening of the arteries,” arteriosclerosis really\\nmeans that the arteries lose their elasticity, and their\\nwalls become weakened. Arteries carry blood under\\nhigh pressure, so deterioration of their walls is part\\nof the aging process.\\nAneurysm—a weak portion of an arterial wall\\nmay bulge out, forming a sac or bubble called an\\naneurysm.

If the\\nveins become overly stretched, the valves within\\nthem no longer close properly. These incompetent\\nvalves no longer prevent backﬂow of blood, leading\\nto further pooling and even further stretching of\\nthe walls of the veins. Varicose veins may cause dis-\\ncomfort and cramping in the legs, or become even\\nmore painful. Severe varicosities may be removed\\nsurgically.\\nThis condition may also develop during preg-\\nnancy, when the enlarged uterus presses against\\nthe iliac veins and slows blood ﬂow into the inferior\\nvena cava. Varicose veins of the anal canal are called\\nhemorrhoids, which may also be a result of preg-\\nnancy or of chronic constipation and straining to\\ndefecate. Hemorrhoids that cause discomfort or\\npain may also be removed surgically. Developments\\nin laser surgery have made this a simpler procedure\\nthan it was in the past.\\nPhlebitis—inﬂammation of a vein.

Some of these substances move from the blood\\nto tissue ﬂuid, and others move from tissue ﬂuid to the\\nblood. The processes by which these substances are\\nexchanged are illustrated in Fig. 13–2.\\nGases move by diffusion, that is, from their area of\\ngreater concentration to their area of lesser concen-\\ntration. Oxygen, therefore, diffuses from the blood in\\nsystemic capillaries to the tissue ﬂuid, and carbon\\ndioxide diffuses from tissue ﬂuid to the blood to be\\nbrought to the lungs and exhaled.\\nLet us now look at the blood pressure as blood\\nenters capillaries from the arterioles. Blood pressure\\nhere is about 30 to 35 mmHg, and the pressure of the\\nsurrounding tissue ﬂuid is much lower, about 2\\nmmHg. Because the capillary blood pressure is higher,\\nthe process of ﬁltration occurs, which forces plasma\\nand dissolved nutrients out of the capillaries and into\\ntissue ﬂuid. This is how nutrients such as glucose,\\namino acids, and vitamins are brought to cells.\\nBlood pressure decreases as blood reaches the\\nvenous end of capillaries, but notice that proteins\\nsuch as albumin have remained in the blood. Albumin\\ncontributes to the colloid osmotic pressure (COP)\\nof blood; this is an “attracting” pressure, a “pulling”\\nrather than a “pushing” pressure. At the venous end\\nof capillaries, the presence of albumin in the blood\\npulls tissue ﬂuid into the capillaries, which also brings\\ninto the blood the waste products produced by\\ncells.

This is discussed fur-\\nther in Chapter 14.\\nPATHWAYS OF CIRCULATION\\nThe two major pathways of circulation are pulmonary\\nand systemic. Pulmonary circulation begins at the\\nright ventricle, and systemic circulation begins at the\\nleft ventricle. Hepatic portal circulation is a special\\nsegment of systemic circulation that will be covered\\nseparately. Fetal circulation involves pathways that are\\npresent only before birth and will also be discussed\\nseparately.\\nPULMONARY CIRCULATION\\nThe right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary\\nartery (or trunk), which divides into the right and left\\npulmonary arteries, one going to each lung. Within\\nthe lungs each artery branches extensively into smaller\\narteries and arterioles, then to capillaries. The pul-\\nmonary capillaries surround the alveoli of the lungs; it\\nis here that exchanges of oxygen and carbon dioxide\\ntake place. The capillaries unite to form venules,\\nwhich merge into veins, and ﬁnally into the two pul-\\nmonary veins from each lung that return blood to the\\nleft atrium. This oxygenated blood will then travel\\nthrough the systemic circulation. (Notice that the pul-\\nmonary veins contain oxygenated blood; these are the\\nonly veins that carry blood with a high oxygen con-\\ntent. The blood in systemic veins has a low oxygen\\ncontent; it is systemic arteries that carry oxygenated\\nblood.)\\nSYSTEMIC CIRCULATION\\nThe left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, the\\nlargest artery of the body. We will return to the aorta\\nand its branches in a moment, but ﬁrst we will sum-\\nmarize the rest of systemic circulation. The branches\\nof the aorta take blood into arterioles and capillary net-\\nworks throughout the body. Capillaries merge to form\\nvenules and veins. The veins from the lower body take\\nblood to the inferior vena cava; veins from the upper\\nbody take blood to the superior vena cava. These two\\ncaval veins return blood to the right atrium. The major\\narteries and veins are shown in Figs. 13–3 to 13–5, and\\ntheir functions are listed in T ables 13–1 and 13–2.\\nThe aorta is a continuous vessel, but for the sake of\\nprecise description it is divided into sections that are\\nnamed anatomically: ascending aorta, aortic arch, tho-\\nracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta\\nis the ﬁrst inch that emerges from the top of the left\\nventricle. The arch of the aorta curves posteriorly over\\nthe heart and turns downward. The thoracic aorta\\ncontinues down through the chest cavity and through\\nthe diaphragm. Below the level of the diaphragm, the\\nabdominal aorta continues to the level of the 4th lum-\\nbar vertebra, where it divides into the two common\\niliac arteries. Along its course, the aorta has many\\nbranches through which blood travels to speciﬁc\\norgans and parts of the body.\\nThe ascending aorta has only two branches: the\\nright and left coronary arteries, which supply blood to\\nthe myocardium. This pathway of circulation was\\ndescribed previously in Chapter 12.\\nThe aortic arch has three branches that supply\\nblood to the head and arms: the brachiocephalic\\nartery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian\\nartery. The brachiocephalic (literally, “arm-head”)\\nartery is very short and divides into the right common\\ncarotid artery and right subclavian artery. The right\\nand left common carotid arteries extend into the neck,\\nwhere each divides into an internal carotid artery and\\nexternal carotid artery, which supply the head. The\\nright and left subclavian arteries are in the shoulders\\nbehind the clavicles and continue into the arms. As the\\nartery enters another body area (it may not “branch,”\\nsimply continue), its name changes: The subclavian\\nartery becomes the axillary artery, which becomes the\\nbrachial artery. The branches of the carotid and sub-\\nclavian arteries are diagrammed in Figs. 13–3 and\\n13–5. As you look at these diagrams, keep in mind that\\nthe name of the vessel often tells us where it is. The\\nfacial artery, for example, is found in the face.\\nSome of the arteries in the head contribute to an\\nimportant arterial anastomosis, the circle of Willis\\n(or cerebral arterial circle), which is a “circle” of arter-\\nies around the pituitary gland (Fig. 13–6). The circle\\nof Willis is formed by the right and left internal\\ncarotid arteries and the basilar artery, which is the\\nunion of the right and left vertebral arteries (branches\\nof the subclavian arteries). The brain is always active,\\n296 The Vascular System\\n(text continued on page 299)\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 296'),\n",

The most important veins are dia-\\ngrammed in Fig. 13–4 and listed in T able 13–2.\\nHEPATIC PORTAL CIRCULATION\\nHepatic portal circulation is a subdivision of sys-\\ntemic circulation in which blood from the abdominal\\ndigestive organs and spleen circulates through the\\nliver before returning to the heart.\\nBlood from the capillaries of the stomach, small\\nintestine, colon, pancreas, and spleen ﬂows into two\\nlarge veins, the superior mesenteric vein and the\\nsplenic vein, which unite to form the portal vein (Fig.\\n13–7). The portal vein takes blood into the liver,\\nwhere it branches extensively and empties blood into\\nthe sinusoids, the capillaries of the liver (see also Fig.\\n16–6). From the sinusoids, blood ﬂows into hepatic\\nveins, to the inferior vena cava and back to the right\\natrium. Notice that in this pathway there are two sets\\nof capillaries, and keep in mind that it is in capillaries\\nthat exchanges take place. Let us use some speciﬁc\\nexamples to show the purpose and importance of por-\\ntal circulation.\\nGlucose from carbohydrate digestion is absorbed\\ninto the capillaries of the small intestine; after a big\\nmeal this may greatly increase the blood glucose level.\\nIf this blood were to go directly back to the heart and\\nthen circulate through the kidneys, some of the glu-\\ncose might be lost in urine. However, blood from the\\nsmall intestine passes ﬁrst through the liver sinusoids,\\nand the liver cells remove the excess glucose and store\\nit as glycogen. The blood that returns to the heart will\\nthen have a blood glucose level in the normal range.\\nAnother example: Alcohol is absorbed into the cap-\\nillaries of the stomach. If it were to circulate directly\\nthroughout the body, the alcohol would rapidly impair\\nthe functioning of the brain. Portal circulation, how-\\never, takes blood from the stomach to the liver, the\\norgan that can detoxify the alcohol and prevent its\\ndetrimental effects on the brain. Of course, if alcohol\\nconsumption continues, the blood alcohol level rises\\nfaster than the liver’s capacity to detoxify, and the well-\\nknown signs of alcohol intoxication appear.\\nAs you can see, this portal circulation pathway\\nenables the liver to modify the blood from the diges-\\ntive organs and spleen. Some nutrients may be stored\\nor changed, bilirubin from the spleen is excreted into\\nbile, and potential poisons are detoxiﬁed before the\\nblood returns to the heart and the rest of the body.\\nFETAL CIRCULATION\\nThe fetus depends upon the mother for oxygen and\\nnutrients and for the removal of carbon dioxide and\\nThe Vascular System 301\\nTable 13–1 MAJOR SYSTEMIC ARTERIES (Continued)\\nBranches of the Abdominal Aorta\\nArtery Region Supplied\\nTesticular or ovarian a.\\nCommon iliac a.\\nInternal iliac a.\\nExternal iliac a.\\nFemoral a.\\nPopliteal a.\\nAnterior tibial a.\\nDorsalis pedis\\nPlantar arches\\nPosterior tibial a.\\nPeroneal a.\\nPlantar arches\\n• Testes or ovaries\\n• The two large vessels that receive blood from the\\nabdominal aorta; each branches as follows:\\n• Bladder, rectum, reproductive organs\\n• Lower pelvis to leg\\n• Thigh\\n• Back of knee\\n• Front of lower leg\\n• Top of ankle and foot\\n• Foot\\n• Back of lower leg\\n• Medial lower leg\\n• Foot\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 301'),\n",

This is the time it\\ntakes for blood to go from the right ventricle to the\\nlungs, back to the heart to be pumped by the left ven-\\ntricle to the body, and return to the heart again.\\nCirculation time is about 1 minute or less, and ensures\\nan adequate exchange of gases.\\nBLOOD PRESSURE\\nBlood pressure is the force the blood exerts against\\nthe walls of the blood vessels. Filtration in capillaries\\ndepends upon blood pressure; ﬁltration brings nutri-\\nents to tissues, and as you will see in Chapter 18, is the\\nﬁrst step in the formation of urine. Blood pressure is\\none of the “vital signs” often measured, and indeed a\\nnormal blood pressure is essential to life.\\nThe pumping of the ventricles creates blood pres-\\nsure, which is measured in mmHg (millimeters of\\nmercury). When a systemic blood pressure reading is\\ntaken, two numbers are obtained: systolic and dias-\\ntolic, as in 110/70 mmHg. Systolic pressure is always\\nthe higher of the two and represents the blood pres-\\nsure when the left ventricle is contracting. The lower\\nnumber is the diastolic pressure, when the left ventri-\\ncle is relaxed and does not exert force. Diastolic pres-\\nsure is maintained by the arteries and arterioles and is\\ndiscussed in a later section.\\nSystemic blood pressure is highest in the aorta,\\nwhich receives all of the blood pumped by the left ven-\\ntricle. As blood travels farther away from the heart,\\nblood pressure decreases (see Fig. 13–9). The brachial\\nartery is most often used to take a blood pressure read-\\ning; here a normal systolic range is 90 to 120 mmHg,\\nand a normal diastolic range is 60 to 80 mmHg. In the\\narterioles, blood pressure decreases further, and sys-\\ntolic and diastolic pressures merge into one pressure.\\nAt the arterial end of capillary networks, blood pres-\\nsure is about 30 to 35 mmHg, decreasing to 12 to 15\\nmmHg at the venous end of capillaries. This is high\\nenough to permit ﬁltration but low enough to prevent\\nrupture of the capillaries. As blood ﬂows through\\nveins, the pressure decreases further, and in the caval\\nveins, blood pressure approaches zero as blood enters\\nthe right atrium.\\nThe upper limit of the normal blood pressure range\\nis now 120/80 mmHg. The levels of 125 to 139/85 to\\n89 mmHg, once considered high-normal, are now\\ncalled “prehypertension,” that is, with the potential to\\nbecome even higher. A systemic blood pressure con-\\nsistently higher than the normal range is called hyper-\\ntension (see also Box 13–4: Hypertension). A lower\\nthan normal blood pressure is called hypotension.\\nThe regulation of systemic blood pressure is discussed\\nin a later section.\\nPulmonary blood pressure is created by the right\\nventricle, which has relatively thin walls and thus exerts\\nabout one-sixth the force of the left ventricle. The\\nresult is that pulmonary arterial pressure is always low:\\n20 to 25/8 to 10 mmHg, and in pulmonary capillaries\\nis lower still. This is important to prevent ﬁltration in\\npulmonary capillaries, which in turn prevents tissue\\nﬂuid from accumulating in the alveoli of the lungs.\\nMAINTENANCE OF SYSTEMIC\\nBLOOD PRESSURE\\nBecause blood pressure is so important, many physio-\\nlogical factors and processes interact to keep blood\\npressure within normal limits:\\n1. Venous return—the amount of blood that returns\\nto the heart by way of the veins. Venous return\\nis important because the heart can pump only\\nthe blood it receives. If venous return decreases,\\nthe cardiac muscle ﬁbers will not be stretched, the\\nforce of ventricular systole will decrease (Starling’s\\nlaw), and blood pressure will decrease. This is what\\nmight happen following a severe hemorrhage.\\nWhen the body is horizontal, venous return can\\nbe maintained fairly easily, but when the body is\\nThe Vascular System 307\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 307'),\n",

Three mecha-\\nnisms help promote venous return: constriction of\\nveins, the skeletal muscle pump, and the respira-\\ntory pump.\\nVeins contain smooth muscle, which enables\\nthem to constrict and force blood toward the heart;\\nthe valves prevent backﬂow of blood. The second\\nmechanism is the skeletal muscle pump, which is\\nespecially effective for the deep veins of the legs.\\nThese veins are surrounded by skeletal muscles\\nthat contract and relax during normal activities\\nsuch as walking. Contractions of the leg muscles\\nsqueeze the veins to force blood toward the heart.\\nThe third mechanism is the respiratory pump ,\\nwhich affects veins that pass through the chest cav-\\nity. The pressure changes of inhalation and exhala-\\ntion alternately expand and compress the veins, and\\nblood is returned to the heart.\\n2. Heart rate and force—in general, if heart rate and\\nforce increase, blood pressure increases; this is\\nwhat happens during exercise. However, if the\\nheart is beating extremely rapidly, the ventricles\\nmay not ﬁll completely between beats, and cardiac\\noutput and blood pressure will decrease.\\n3. Peripheral resistance —this term refers to the\\nresistance the vessels offer to the ﬂow of blood.\\nThe arteries and veins are usually slightly con-\\nstricted, which maintains normal diastolic blood\\npressure. It may be helpful to think of the vessels\\nas the “container” for the blood. If a person’s body\\nhas 5 liters of blood, the “container” must be\\nsmaller in order for the blood to exert a pressure\\nagainst its walls. This is what normal vasoconstric-\\ntion does: It makes the container (the vessels)\\nsmaller than the volume of blood so that the blood\\nwill exert pressure even when the left ventricle is\\nrelaxed.\\n308 The Vascular System\\nBOX 13–4 HYPERTENSION\\ntrophy. This abnormal growth of the myocardium,\\nhowever, is not accompanied by a corresponding\\ngrowth in coronary capillaries, and the blood supply\\nof the left ventricle may not be adequate for all sit-\\nuations. Exercise, for example, puts further\\ndemands on the heart, and the person may experi-\\nence angina due to a lack of oxygen or a myocar-\\ndial infarction if there is a severe oxygen deﬁciency.\\nAlthough several different kinds of medications\\n(diuretics, vasodilators) are used to treat hyperten-\\nsion, people with moderate hypertension may limit\\ntheir dependence on medications by following cer-\\ntain guidelines:\\n1. Don’t smoke, because nicotine stimulates vaso-\\nconstriction, which raises BP. Smoking also dam-\\nages arteries, contributing to arteriosclerosis.\\n2. Lose weight if overweight. A weight loss of as lit-\\ntle as 10 pounds can lower BP. A diet high in\\nfruits and vegetables may, for some people, con-\\ntribute to lower BP.\\n3. Cut salt intake in half. Although salt consump-\\ntion may not be the cause of hypertension,\\nreducing salt intake may help lower blood pres-\\nsure by decreasing blood volume.\\n4. Exercise on a regular basis. A moderate amount\\nof aerobic exercise (such as a half hour walk\\nevery day) is beneﬁcial for the entire cardiovas-\\ncular system and may also contribute to weight\\nloss.\\nHypertension is high blood pressure, that is, a rest-\\ning systemic pressure consistently above the normal\\nrange (90 to 120/60 to 80 mmHg). Clinicians now\\nconsider 125 to 139/85 to 89 mmHg to be prehy-\\npertension. A systolic reading of 140 to 159 mmHg\\nor a diastolic reading of 90 to 99 mmHg may be\\ncalled stage 1 hypertension, and a systolic reading\\nabove 160 mmHg or a diastolic reading above 100\\nmmHg may be called stage 2 hypertension.\\nThe term “essential hypertension” means that no\\nspeciﬁc cause can be determined; most cases are in\\nthis category. For some people, however, an over-\\nproduction of renin by the kidneys is the cause\\nof their hypertension. Excess renin increases the\\nproduction of angiotensin II, which raises blood\\npressure. Although hypertension often produces no\\nsymptoms, the long-term consequences may be\\nvery serious. Chronic hypertension has its greatest\\neffects on the arteries and on the heart.\\nAlthough the walls of arteries are strong, hyper-\\ntension weakens them and contributes to arte-\\nriosclerosis. Such weakened arteries may rupture or\\ndevelop aneurysms, which may in turn lead to a\\nCVA or kidney damage.\\nHypertension affects the heart because the left\\nventricle must now pump blood against the higher\\narterial pressure.

This is what happens in a stress situation,\\nwhen greater vasoconstriction is brought about\\nby sympathetic impulses. If vasodilation occurs,\\nblood pressure will decrease (the container is\\nlarger). After eating a large meal, for example, there\\nis extensive vasodilation in the digestive tract to\\nsupply more oxygenated blood for digestive activi-\\nties. T o keep blood pressure within the normal\\nrange, vasoconstriction must, and does, occur else-\\nwhere in the body. This is why strenuous exercise\\nshould be avoided right after eating; there is not\\nenough blood to completely supply oxygen to exer-\\ncising muscles and an active digestive tract at the\\nsame time.\\n4. Elasticity of the large arteries —when the left\\nventricle contracts, the blood that enters the large\\narteries stretches their walls. The arterial walls are\\nelastic and absorb some of the force. When the left\\nventricle relaxes, the arterial walls recoil or snap\\nback, which helps keep diastolic pressure within\\nthe normal range. Normal elasticity, therefore,\\nlowers systolic pressure, raises diastolic pressure,\\nand maintains a normal pulse pressure. (Pulse pres-\\nsure is the difference between systolic and diastolic\\npressure. The usual ratio of systolic to diastolic to\\npulse pressure is approximately 3:2:1. For example,\\nwith a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, the pulse\\npressure is 40, and the ratio is 120:80:40, or 3:2:1.)\\n5. Viscosity of the blood —normal blood viscosity\\ndepends upon the presence of red blood cells and\\nplasma proteins, especially albumin. Having too\\nmany red blood cells is rare but does occur in the\\ndisorder called polycythemia vera and in people\\nwho are heavy smokers. This will increase blood\\nviscosity and blood pressure.\\nA decreased number of red blood cells, as is seen\\nwith severe anemia, or decreased albumin, as may\\noccur in liver disease or kidney disease, will\\ndecrease blood viscosity and blood pressure. In\\nthese situations, other mechanisms such as vaso-\\nconstriction will maintain blood pressure as close to\\nnormal as is possible.\\n6. Loss of blood —a small loss of blood, as when\\ndonating a pint of blood, will cause a temporary\\ndrop in blood pressure followed by rapid compen-\\nsation in the form of a more rapid heart rate and\\ngreater vasoconstriction. After a severe hemor-\\nrhage, however, these compensating mechanisms\\nmay not be sufficient to maintain normal blood\\npressure and blood ﬂow to the brain. Although a\\nperson may survive loss of 50% of the body’s total\\nblood, the possibility of brain damage increases as\\nmore blood is lost and not rapidly replaced.\\n7. Hormones—several hormones have effects on\\nblood pressure. Y ou may recall them from Chapters\\n10 and 12, but we will summarize them here and in\\nFig. 13–10. The adrenal medulla secretes norepi-\\nnephrine and epinephrine in stress situations.\\nNorepinephrine stimulates vasoconstriction, which\\nraises blood pressure. Epinephrine also causes vaso-\\nconstriction, and increases heart rate and force of\\ncontraction, both of which increase blood pressure.\\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted by the\\nposterior pituitary gland when the water content of\\nthe body decreases. ADH increases the reabsorp-\\ntion of water by the kidneys to prevent further loss\\nof water in urine and a further decrease in blood\\npressure.\\nAldosterone, a hormone from the adrenal cor-\\ntex, has a similar effect on blood volume. When\\nblood pressure decreases, secretion of aldosterone\\nstimulates the reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions by the kid-\\nneys. Water follows sodium back to the blood,\\nwhich maintains blood volume to prevent a further\\ndrop in blood pressure.\\nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted by the\\natria of the heart, functions in opposition to aldos-\\nterone. ANP increases the excretion of Na\\n/H11001ions\\nand water by the kidneys, which decreases blood\\nvolume and lowers blood pressure.\\nDISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW\\nAn individual’s blood volume remains relatively con-\\nstant within the normal range appropriate to the size\\nof the person. Active tissues, however, require more\\nblood, that is, more oxygen, than do less active tissues.\\nAs active tissues and organs receive a greater propor-\\ntion of the total blood ﬂow, less active organs must\\nreceive less, or blood pressure will decrease markedly.\\nAs mentioned previously, precapillary sphincters\\ndilate in active tissues and constrict in less active ones.\\nThe arterioles also constrict to reduce blood ﬂow to\\nless active organs. This ensures that metabolically\\nactive organs will receive enough oxygen to function\\nproperly and that blood pressure for the body as a\\nwhole will be maintained within normal limits.\\nAn example will be helpful here; let us use the\\nbody at rest and the body during exercise.

The cholesterol deposits\\nof atherosclerosis are to be expected with advancing\\nage, with the most serious consequences in the coro-\\nnary arteries. A certain degree of arteriosclerosis is to\\nbe expected, and average resting blood pressure may\\nincrease, which further damages arterial walls.\\nConsequences include stroke and left-sided heart\\nfailure.\\nThe veins also deteriorate with age; their thin walls\\nweaken and stretch, making their valves incompetent.\\nThis is most likely to occur in the veins of the legs;\\ntheir walls are subject to great pressure as blood is\\nreturned to the heart against the force of gravity.\\nVaricose veins and phlebitis are more likely to occur\\namong elderly people.\\nSUMMARY\\nAlthough the vascular system does form passageways\\nfor the blood, you can readily see that the blood ves-\\nsels are not simply pipes through which the blood\\nﬂows. The vessels are not passive tubes, but rather\\nactive contributors to homeostasis. The arteries and\\nveins help maintain blood pressure, and the capillaries\\nprovide sites for the exchanges of materials between\\nthe blood and the tissues. Some very important sites of\\nexchange are discussed in the following chapters: the\\nlungs, the digestive tract, and the kidneys.\\n314 The Vascular System\\nBOX 13–5 CIRCULATORY SHOCK\\nStages of Shock\\nCompensated shock—the responses by the body\\nmaintain cardiac output. Following a small hemor-\\nrhage, for example, the heart rate increases,\\nthe blood vessels constrict, and the kidneys\\ndecrease urinary output to conserve water. These\\nresponses help preserve blood volume and main-\\ntain blood pressure, cardiac output, and blood ﬂow\\nto tissues.\\nProgressive shock —the state of shock leads to\\nmore shock. Following a severe hemorrhage, car-\\ndiac output decreases and the myocardium itself is\\ndeprived of blood. The heart weakens, which fur-\\nther decreases cardiac output. Arteries that are\\ndeprived of their blood supply cannot remain con-\\nstricted. As the arteries dilate, venous return\\ndecreases, which in turn decreases cardiac output.\\nProgressive shock is a series of such vicious cycles,\\nand medical intervention is required to restore car-\\ndiac output to normal.\\nIrreversible shock—no amount of medical assis-\\ntance can restore cardiac output to normal. The\\nusual cause of death is that the heart has been dam-\\naged too much to recover. A severe myocardial\\ninfarction, massive hemorrhage, or septicemia may\\nall be fatal despite medical treatment.\\nCirculatory shock is any condition in which cardiac\\noutput decreases to the extent that tissues are\\ndeprived of oxygen and waste products accumulate.\\nCauses of Shock\\nCardiogenic shock occurs most often after a\\nsevere myocardial infarction but may also be the\\nresult of ventricular ﬁbrillation. In either case, the\\nheart is no longer an efficient pump, and cardiac\\noutput decreases.\\nHypovolemic shock is the result of decreased\\nblood volume, often due to severe hemorrhage.\\nOther possible causes are extreme sweating (heat\\nstroke) or extreme loss of water through the kid-\\nneys (diuresis) or intestines (diarrhea). In these\\nsituations, the heart simply does not have enough\\nblood to pump, and cardiac output decreases.\\nAnaphylactic shock, also in this category, is a mas-\\nsive allergic reaction in which great amounts of\\nhistamine increase capillary permeability and\\nvasodilation throughout the body. Much plasma is\\nthen lost to tissue spaces, which decreases blood\\nvolume, blood pressure, and cardiac output.\\nSeptic shock is the result of septicemia, the\\npresence of bacteria in the blood. The bacteria and\\ndamaged tissues release inﬂammatory chemicals\\nthat cause vasodilation and extensive loss of plasma\\ninto tissue spaces.\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 314'),\n",

The ductus arteriosus permits blood to ﬂow from\\nthe pulmonary artery to the aorta to bypass the\\nfetal lungs.\\n7. These fetal structures become nonfunctional after\\nbirth, when the umbilical cord is cut and breathing\\ntakes place.\\nVelocity of Blood Flow (see Fig. 13–9)\\n1. Velocity is inversely related to the cross-sectional\\narea of a segment of the vascular system.\\n2. The total capillaries have the greatest cross-\\nsectional area and slowest blood ﬂow.\\n3. Slow ﬂow in the capillaries is important to permit\\nsufficient time for exchange of gases, nutrients, and\\nwastes.\\nBlood Pressure (BP)—the force exerted by\\nthe blood against the walls of the blood ves-\\nsels (Fig. 13–9)\\n1. BP is measured in mmHg: systolic/diastolic.\\nSystolic pressure occurs during ventricular con-\\ntraction; diastolic pressure occurs during ventricu-\\nlar relaxation.\\n2. Normal range of systemic arterial BP: 90 to 120/60\\nto 80 mmHg.\\n3. BP in capillaries is 30 to 35 mmHg at the arterial\\nend and 12 to 15 mmHg at the venous end—high\\nenough to permit ﬁltration but low enough to pre-\\nvent rupture of the capillaries.\\n4. BP decreases in the veins and approaches zero in\\nthe caval veins.\\n5. Pulmonary BP is always low (the right ventricle\\npumps with less force): 20 to 25/8 to 10 mmHg.\\nThis low BP prevents ﬁltration and accumulation\\nof tissue ﬂuid in the alveoli.\\nMaintenance of Systemic BP\\n1. Venous return—the amount of blood that returns\\nto the heart. If venous return decreases, the heart\\ncontracts less forcefully (Starling’s law) and BP\\ndecreases. The mechanisms that maintain venous\\nreturn when the body is vertical are:\\n• Constriction of veins with the valves preventing\\nbackﬂow of blood\\n• Skeletal muscle pump—contraction of skeletal\\nmuscles, especially in the legs, squeezes the deep\\nveins\\n• Respiratory pump—the pressure changes of\\ninhalation and exhalation expand and compress\\nthe veins in the chest cavity\\n2. Heart rate and force—if heart rate and force\\nincrease, BP increases.\\n3. Peripheral resistance—the resistance of the arteries\\nand arterioles to the ﬂow of blood. These vessels\\nare usually slightly constricted to maintain normal\\ndiastolic BP . Greater vasoconstriction will increase\\nBP; vasodilation will decrease BP . In the body,\\nvasodilation in one area requires vasoconstriction\\nin another area to maintain normal BP .\\n4. Elasticity of the large arteries—ventricular systole\\nstretches the walls of large arteries, which recoil\\nduring ventricular diastole. Normal elasticity low-\\ners systolic BP , raises diastolic BP , and maintains\\nnormal pulse pressure.\\n5. Viscosity of blood—depends on RBCs and plasma\\nproteins, especially albumin. Severe anemia tends\\nto decrease BP . Deﬁciency of albumin as in liver or\\nkidney disease tends to decrease BP . In these cases,\\ncompensation such as greater vasoconstriction will\\nkeep BP close to normal.\\n6. Loss of blood—a small loss will be rapidly com-\\npensated for by faster heart rate and greater vaso-\\nconstriction. After severe hemorrhage, these\\nmechanisms may not be sufficient to maintain nor-\\nmal BP .\\n7. Hormones—(see Fig. 13–10) (a) Norepinephrine\\nstimulates vasoconstriction, which raises BP; (b)\\nepinephrine increases cardiac output and raises BP;\\n(c) ADH increases water reabsorption by the kid-\\nneys, which increases blood volume and BP; (d)\\naldosterone increases reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions by\\nthe kidneys; water follows Na/H11001and increases blood\\nvolume and BP; (e) ANP increases excretion of\\nNa\\n/H11001ions and water by the kidneys, which de-\\ncreases blood volume and BP .\\nDistribution of Blood Flow\\n1. Metabolically active tissues require more oxygen,\\nand receive a greater proportion of the blood vol-\\nume as it circulates (see Fig. 13–11).\\n2. Blood ﬂow is increased by the dilation of arterioles\\nand precapillary sphincters.\\n3. In less active tissues, arterioles and precapillary\\nsphincters constrict.\\n4. Organs receive sufficient oxygen, and BP for the\\nbody is maintained within the normal range.\\n316 The Vascular System\\n13Scanlon(p3)-ch13  8/17/06  10:54 AM  Page 316'),\n",

Is this likely to\\nbe a life-threatening injury? Probably not, even\\nthough the breaks in the skin have permitted the entry\\nof thousands or even millions of bacteria. Those bac-\\nteria, however, will be quickly destroyed by the cells\\nand organs of the lymphatic system.\\nAlthough the lymphatic system may be considered\\npart of the circulatory system, we will consider it sep-\\narately because its functions are so different from\\nthose of the heart and blood vessels. Keep in mind,\\nhowever, that all of these functions are interdepend-\\nent. The lymphatic system is responsible for returning\\ntissue ﬂuid to the blood and for protecting the body\\nagainst foreign material. The parts of the lymphatic\\nsystem are the lymph, the system of lymph vessels, and\\nlymphatic tissue, which includes lymph nodes and\\nnodules, the spleen, and the thymus gland.\\nLYMPH\\nLymph is the name for tissue ﬂuid that enters lymph\\ncapillaries. As you may recall from Chapter 13, ﬁltra-\\ntion in capillaries creates tissue ﬂuid from blood\\nplasma, most of which returns almost immediately to\\nthe blood in the capillaries by osmosis. Some tissue\\nﬂuid, however, remains in interstitial spaces and must\\nbe returned to the blood by way of the lymphatic ves-\\nsels. Without this return, blood volume and blood\\npressure would very soon decrease. The relationship\\nof the lymphatic vessels to the cardiovascular system is\\ndepicted in Fig. 14–1.\\nLYMPH VESSELS\\nThe system of lymph vessels begins as dead-end\\nlymph capillaries found in most tissue spaces (Fig.\\n14–2). Lymph capillaries are very permeable and col-\\nlect tissue ﬂuid and proteins. Lacteals are specialized\\nlymph capillaries in the villi of the small intestine; they\\nabsorb the fat-soluble end products of digestion, such\\nas fatty acids and vitamins A, D, E, and K.\\nLymph capillaries unite to form larger lymph ves-\\nsels, whose structure is very much like that of veins.\\nThere is no pump for lymph (as the heart is the pump\\nfor blood), but the lymph is kept moving within lymph\\nvessels by the same mechanisms that promote venous\\nreturn. The smooth muscle layer of the larger lymph\\nvessels constricts, and the one-way valves (just like\\nthose of veins) prevent backﬂow of lymph. Lymph ves-\\nsels in the extremities, especially the legs, are com-\\npressed by the skeletal muscles that surround them;\\nthis is the skeletal muscle pump . The respiratory\\npump alternately expands and compresses the lymph\\nvessels in the chest cavity and keeps the lymph moving.\\nWhere is the lymph going? Back to the blood to\\nbecome plasma again. Refer to Fig. 14–3 as you read\\nthe following. The lymph vessels from the lower body\\nunite in front of the lumbar vertebrae to form a vessel\\ncalled the cisterna chyli, which continues upward in\\nfront of the backbone as the thoracic duct . Lymph\\nvessels from the upper left quadrant of the body join\\nthe thoracic duct, which empties lymph into the left\\nsubclavian vein. Lymph vessels from the upper right\\nquadrant of the body unite to form the right lymphatic\\nduct, which empties lymph into the right subclavian\\nvein. Flaps in both subclavian veins permit the entry of\\nlymph but prevent blood from ﬂowing into the lymph\\nvessels.\\nLYMPHATIC TISSUE\\nLymphatic tissue consists mainly of lymphocytes in a\\nmesh-like framework of connective tissue. Recall that\\nmost lymphocytes are produced from stem cells in the\\nred bone marrow, then migrate to the lymph nodes\\nand nodules, to the spleen, and to the thymus. In these\\nstructures, lymphocytes become activated and prolif-\\nerate in response to infection (this is a function of all\\nlymphatic tissue). The thymus has stem cells that pro-\\nduce a signiﬁcant portion of the T lymphocytes.\\nLYMPH NODES AND NODULES\\nLymph nodes and nodules are masses of lymphatic\\ntissue. Nodes and nodules differ with respect to size\\nand location. Nodes are usually larger, 10 to 20 mm in\\nlength, and are encapsulated; nodules range from a\\nfraction of a millimeter to several millimeters in length\\nand do not have capsules.\\nLymph nodes are found in groups along the path-\\nways of lymph vessels, and lymph ﬂows through these\\nnodes on its way to the subclavian veins. Lymph enters\\na node through several afferent lymph vessels and\\n322 The Lymphatic System and Immunity\\n14Scanlon(p3)-ch14  8/17/06  10:56 AM  Page 322'),\n",

For example, if bacteria in inhaled air get\\nthrough the epithelium of the trachea, lymph nodules\\nwith their macrophages are in position to destroy these\\nbacteria before they get to the blood.\\nSome of the lymph nodules have speciﬁc names.\\nThose of the small intestine are called Peyer’s\\npatches, and those of the pharynx are called tonsils.\\nThe palatine tonsils are on the lateral walls of the\\npharynx, the adenoid (pharyngeal tonsil) is on the pos-\\nterior wall, and the lingual tonsils are on the base of\\nthe tongue. The tonsils, therefore, form a ring of lym-\\nphatic tissue around the pharynx, which is a common\\npathway for food and air and for the pathogens they\\ncontain. A tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of\\nthe palatine tonsils and the adenoid and may be per-\\nformed if the tonsils are chronically inﬂamed and\\nswollen, as may happen in children. As mentioned ear-\\nlier, the body has redundant structures to help ensure\\nsurvival if one structure is lost or seriously impaired.\\nThus, there are many other lymph nodules in the\\npharynx to take over the function of the surgically\\nremoved tonsils.\\nSPLEEN\\nThe spleen is located in the upper left quadrant of the\\nabdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm, behind\\nthe stomach. The lower rib cage protects the spleen\\nfrom physical trauma (see Fig. 14–3).\\nIn the fetus, the spleen produces red blood cells, a\\nfunction assumed by the red bone marrow after birth.\\nAfter birth the spleen is very much like a large lymph\\nnode, except that its functions affect the blood that\\nﬂows through it rather than lymph.\\nThe functions of the spleen after birth are:\\n1. Contains plasma cells that produce antibodies to\\nforeign antigens.\\n2. Contains ﬁxed macrophages (RE cells) that phago-\\ncytize pathogens or other foreign material in the\\nblood. The macrophages of the spleen also phago-\\ncytize old red blood cells and form bilirubin. By\\nway of portal circulation, the bilirubin is sent to the\\nliver for excretion in bile.\\n3. Stores platelets and destroys them when they are\\nno longer useful.\\nThe spleen is not considered a vital organ, because\\nother organs compensate for its functions if the spleen\\nmust be removed. The liver and red bone marrow\\nwill remove old red blood cells and platelets from cir-\\nculation. The many lymph nodes and nodules will\\nphagocytize pathogens (as will the liver) and have lym-\\nphocytes to be activated and plasma cells to produce\\nantibodies. Despite this redundancy, a person without\\na spleen is somewhat more susceptible to certain bac-\\nterial infections such as pneumonia and meningitis.\\nTHYMUS\\nThe thymus is located inferior to the thyroid gland.\\nIn the fetus and infant, the thymus is large and extends\\nunder the sternum (Fig. 14–5). With increasing age,\\nthe thymus shrinks, and relatively little thymus tissue\\nis found in adults, though it is still active.\\n324 The Lymphatic System and Immunity\\nTissue fluid\\nCellsLymph\\ncapillary\\nVenule\\nBlood capillary\\nArteriole\\nFigure 14–2.

This ability\\nis of vital importance because the body is exposed to\\npathogens from the moment of birth.\\nAntigens are chemical markers that identify cells.\\nHuman cells have their own antigens that identify all\\nthe cells in an individual as “self ” (recall the HLA\\ntypes mentioned in Chapter 11). When antigens are\\nforeign, or “non-self,” they may be recognized as such\\nand destroyed. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa\\nare all foreign antigens that activate immune re-\\nsponses, as are cell products such as bacterial toxins.\\nMalignant cells, which may be formed within the\\nbody as a result of mutations of normal cells, are also\\nrecognized as foreign and are usually destroyed before\\nthey can establish themselves and cause cancer. Unfor-\\ntunately, organ transplants are also foreign tissue, and\\nthe immune system may reject (destroy) a transplanted\\nkidney or heart. Sometimes the immune system mis-\\ntakenly reacts to part of the body itself and causes\\nan autoimmune disease; several of these were men-\\ntioned in previous chapters. Most often, however, the\\nimmune mechanisms function to protect the body\\nfrom the microorganisms around us and within us.\\nImmunity has two main components: innate immu-\\nnity and adaptive immunity. Before we describe each\\ncomponent, a brief general comparison may be help-\\nful. Innate immunity may be called nonspeciﬁc, does\\nnot create memory, and its responses are always the\\nsame regardless of the target. Adaptive immunity is\\nvery speciﬁc as to its target, may involve antibodies,\\ndoes create memory, and may become more efficient.\\nBoth kinds of immunity work together to prevent\\ndamage and disease.\\nINNATE IMMUNITY\\nInnate immunity has several aspects: anatomic and\\nphysiological barriers, phagocytic and other defensive\\ncells, and chemical secretions and reactions, including\\ninﬂammation. These are not separate and distinct;\\nrather there is a great deal of overlap among them, as\\nyou will see. The innate immune responses are always\\nthe same, and their degree of efficiency does not\\nincrease with repeated exposure.\\nBarriers\\nThe stratum corneum of the epidermis of the skin is\\nnon-living, and when unbroken is an excellent barrier\\nto pathogens of all kinds. The fatty acids in sebum\\nhelp limit the growth of bacteria on the skin. The liv-\\ning cells of the epidermis produce defensins, which are\\nantimicrobial chemicals. The mucous membranes of\\nthe respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive\\ntracts are living tissue, yet still a good barrier.

The\\nindividual is prompted to seek medical attention\\nbecause of other symptoms: chronic fever,\\nfatigue, and weight loss.

The subcuta-\\nneous tissue contains many white blood cells (WBCs),\\nas does the areolar connective tissue below the epithe-\\nlium of mucous membranes.\\nDefensive Cells\\nRecall from Chapter 11 that many of our defensive\\ncells are white blood cells. Macrophages, both ﬁxed\\nand wandering, have receptors for the pathogens\\nhumans are likely to encounter (this probably reﬂects\\nmillions of years of coexistence) and are very efficient\\nphagocytes. Other cells capable of phagocytosis of\\npathogens or other foreign antigens are the neutro-\\nphils and, to a lesser extent, the eosinophils. Phago-\\ncytic cells use intracellular enzymes and chemicals\\nsuch as hydrogen peroxide (H\\n2O2) to destroy ingested\\npathogens.\\nThe Langerhans cells of the skin, and other den-\\ndritic cells throughout the body, also phagocytize for-\\neign material, not merely to destroy it, but to take it to\\na lymph node where the lymphocytes of adaptive\\nimmune mechanisms are then activated. The macro-\\nphages are also involved in activating these lympho-\\ncytes. This is a very important link between the two\\ncomponents of immunity.\\nNatural killer cells (NK cells) circulate in the\\nblood but are also found in the red bone marrow,\\nspleen, and lymph nodes. They are a small portion\\n(about 10%) of the total lymphocytes, but are able to\\ndestroy many kinds of pathogens and tumor cells. NK\\ncells make direct contact with foreign cells, and kill\\nthem by rupturing their cell membranes (with chemi-\\ncals called perforins) or by inﬂicting some other kind\\nof chemical damage.\\nBasophils and mast cells (a type of connective tissue\\ncell) are also defensive cells that are found throughout\\nareolar connective tissue. They produce histamine and\\nleukotrienes. Histamine causes vasodilation and makes\\ncapillaries more permeable; these are aspects of\\ninﬂammation. Leukotrienes also increase capillary\\npermeability and attract phagocytic cells to the area.\\nChemical Defenses\\nChemicals that help the body resist infection include\\nthe interferons, complement, and the chemicals\\ninvolved in inﬂammation. The interferons (alpha-,\\nbeta-, and gamma-interferons) are proteins produced\\nby cells infected with viruses and by T cells. Viruses\\nmust be inside a living cell to reproduce, and although\\ninterferon cannot prevent the entry of viruses into\\ncells, it does block their reproduction. When viral\\nreproduction is blocked, the viruses cannot infect new\\ncells and cause disease. Interferon is probably a factor\\nin the self-limiting nature of many viral diseases (and\\nis used in the treatment of some diseases, such as hep-\\natitis C).\\nComplement is a group of more than 20 plasma\\nproteins that circulate in the blood until activated.\\nThey are involved in the lysis of cellular antigens and\\nthe labeling of noncellular antigens. Some stimulate\\nthe release of histamine in inﬂammation; others\\nattract WBCs to the site.\\nInﬂammation is a general response to damage of\\nany kind: microbial, chemical, or physical. Basophils\\nand mast cells release histamine and leukotrienes,\\nwhich affect blood vessels as previously described.\\nVasodilation increases blood ﬂow to the damaged area,\\nand capillaries become more permeable; tissue ﬂuid\\nand WBCs collect at the site. The purpose of inﬂam-\\nmation is to try to contain the damage, keep it from\\nspreading, eliminate the cause, and permit repair of the\\ntissue to begin. From even this brief description you\\ncan see why the four signs of inﬂammation are redness,\\nheat, swelling, and pain: redness from greater blood\\nﬂow, heat from the blood and greater metabolic activ-\\nity, swelling from the accumulation of tissue ﬂuid, and\\npain from the damage itself and perhaps the swelling.\\nAs mentioned in Chapter 10, inﬂammation is a pos-\\nitive feedback mechanism that may become a vicious\\ncycle of damage and more damage. The hormone cor-\\ntisol is one brake that prevents this, and at least one of\\nthe complement proteins has this function as well.\\nThere are probably other chemical signals (in general\\ncalled cytokines and chemokines) that help limit\\ninﬂammation to an extent that is useful.\\nIn summary, innate immunity is nonspeciﬁc, is\\nalways the same, does not create memory, and does\\nnot become more efficient upon repeated exposures.\\nSome cells of innate immune mechanisms also activate\\nthe adaptive immune mechanisms.

Adaptive immunity is spe-\\nciﬁc and is carried out by lymphocytes and macro-\\nphages.\\nThe majority of lymphocytes are the T lympho-\\ncytes and B lymphocytes, or, more simply, T cells and\\nB cells . In the embryo, T cells are produced in the\\nbone marrow and thymus. They must pass through\\nthe thymus, where the thymic hormones bring about\\ntheir maturation. The T cells then migrate to the\\nspleen, lymph nodes, and lymph nodules, where they\\nare found after birth.\\nProduced in the embryonic bone marrow, B cells\\nmigrate directly to the spleen and lymph nodes and\\nnodules. When activated during an immune response,\\nsome B cells will divide many times and become\\nplasma cells that produce antibodies to a speciﬁc for-\\neign antigen.\\nThe mechanisms of immunity that involve T cells\\nand B cells are speciﬁc, meaning that one foreign anti-\\ngen is the target each time a mechanism is activated. A\\nmacrophage has receptor sites for foreign chemicals\\nsuch as those of bacterial cell walls or ﬂagella, and may\\nphagocytize just about any foreign material it comes\\nacross (as will the Langerhans or dendritic cells). T\\ncells and B cells, however, become very speciﬁc, as you\\nwill see.\\nThe ﬁrst step in the destruction of a pathogen or\\nforeign cell is the recognition of its antigens as for-\\neign. Both T cells and B cells are capable of this, but\\nthe immune mechanisms are activated especially well\\nwhen this recognition is accomplished by macro-\\nphages and a specialized group of T lymphocytes\\ncalled helper T cells (also called CD4 T cells). The\\nforeign antigen is ﬁrst phagocytized by a macrophage,\\nand parts of it are “presented” on the macrophage’s\\ncell membrane. Also on the macrophage membrane\\nare “self” antigens that are representative of the\\nantigens found on all of the cells of the individual.\\nTherefore, the helper T cell that encounters this\\nmacrophage is presented not only with the foreign\\nantigen but also with “self” antigens for comparison.\\nThe helper T cell becomes sensitized to and speciﬁc\\nfor the foreign antigen, the one that does not belong\\nin the body (see Box 14–2: AIDS).\\nThe recognition of an antigen as foreign initiates\\none or both of the mechanisms of adaptive immunity.\\nThese are cell-mediated immunity (sometimes\\ncalled simply cellular immunity), in which T cells and\\nmacrophages participate, and antibody-mediated\\nimmunity (or humoral immunity), which involves T\\ncells, B cells, and macrophages.\\nCell-Mediated Immunity\\nThis mechanism of immunity does not result in the\\nproduction of antibodies, but it is effective against\\nintracellular pathogens (such as viruses), fungi,\\nmalignant cells, and grafts of foreign tissue. As men-\\ntioned earlier, the ﬁrst step is the recognition of the\\nforeign antigen by macrophages and helper T cells,\\nwhich become activated and are speciﬁc. (Y ou may\\nﬁnd it helpful to refer to Fig. 14–7 as you read the fol-\\nlowing.)\\nThese activated T cells, which are antigen speciﬁc,\\ndivide many times to form memory T cells and cyto-\\ntoxic (killer) T cells (also called CD8 T cells). The\\nmemory T cells will remember the speciﬁc foreign\\nantigen and become active if it enters the body again.\\nCytotoxic T cells are able to chemically destroy for-\\neign antigens by disrupting cell membranes. This\\nis how cytotoxic T cells destroy cells infected with\\nviruses and prevent the viruses from reproducing.\\nThese T cells also produce cytokines, which are chem-\\nicals that attract macrophages to the area and activate\\nthem to phagocytize the foreign antigen and cellular\\ndebris.\\nIt was once believed that another subset of T cells\\nserved to stop the immune response, but this may not\\nbe so. It seems probable that the CD4 and CD8 T\\ncells also produce feedback chemicals to limit the\\nimmune response once the foreign antigen has been\\ndestroyed. The memory T cells, however, will quickly\\ninitiate the cell-mediated immune response should\\nthere be a future exposure to the antigen.\\nAntibody-Mediated Immunity\\nThis mechanism of immunity does involve the pro-\\nduction of antibodies and is also diagrammed in Fig.\\n14–7. Again, the ﬁrst step is the recognition of the for-\\neign antigen, this time by B cells as well as by\\nmacrophages and helper T cells. The sensitized helper\\nT cell presents the foreign antigen to B cells, which\\nprovides a strong stimulus for the activation of B cells\\nspeciﬁc for this antigen.

By the 1990s, however, it was clear that\\nAIDS was becoming more of a heterosexually trans-\\nmitted disease, with rapidly increasing case rates\\namong women and teenagers. In much of the rest\\nof the world, especially Africa and Asia, the trans-\\nmission of AIDS has always been primarily by het-\\nerosexual contact, with equal numbers of women\\nand men infected. In many of these countries AIDS\\nis an enormous public health problem, and the\\nannual number of new cases is still rising.\\nAt present we have no medications that will\\neradicate HIV, although certain combinations of\\ndrugs effectively suppress the virus in some people.\\nFor these people, AIDS may become a chronic but\\nnot fatal disease. Unfortunately, the medications do\\nnot work for everyone, and they are very expensive,\\nbeyond the means of most of the world’s AIDS\\npatients.\\nDevelopment of an AIDS vaccine has not yet\\nbeen successful, although dozens of vaccines are\\nundergoing clinical trials. A vaccine stimulates anti-\\nbody production to a speciﬁc pathogen, but every-\\none who has died of AIDS had antibodies to HIV.\\nThose antibodies were not protective because HIV is\\na mutating virus; it constantly changes itself, mak-\\ning previously produced antibodies ineffective. An\\nAIDS vaccine may not be entirely effective, may not\\nhave the 80% to 90% protection rate we have\\ncome to expect from vaccines.\\nIf we cannot cure AIDS and we cannot yet pre-\\nvent it by vaccination, what recourse is left?\\nEducation. Everyone should know how AIDS is\\nspread. The obvious reason is to be able to avoid\\nthe high-risk behaviors that make acquiring HIV\\nmore likely. Yet another reason, however, is that\\neveryone should know that they need not fear\\ncasual contact with people with AIDS. Healthcare\\npersonnel have a special responsibility, not only to\\neducate themselves, but to provide education\\nabout AIDS for their patients and the families of\\ntheir patients.\\nIn 1981, young homosexual men in New York and\\nCalifornia were diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma\\nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. At that time,\\nKaposi’s sarcoma was known as a rare, slowly grow-\\ning malignancy in elderly men. Pneumocystis pneu-\\nmonia was almost unheard of; P. carinii (now P.\\njiroveci) is a pathogen that does not cause disease in\\nhealthy people. That in itself was a clue. These\\nyoung men were not healthy; their immune sys-\\ntems were not functioning normally. As the number\\nof patients increased rapidly, the disease was given\\na name (acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome—\\nAIDS) and the pathogen was found. Human\\nimmunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that\\ninfects helper T cells, macrophages, and other\\nhuman cells. Once infected, the human cells con-\\ntain HIV genes for the rest of their lives. Without suf-\\nﬁcient helper T cells, the immune system is seriously\\nimpaired. Foreign antigens are not recognized, B\\ncells are not activated, and killer T cells are not\\nstimulated to proliferate.\\nThe person with AIDS is susceptible to oppor-\\ntunistic infections, that is, those infections caused\\nby fungi and protozoa that would not affect aver-\\nage healthy adults. Some of these infections may be\\ntreated with medications and even temporarily\\ncured, but the immune system cannot prevent the\\nnext infection, or the next. As of this writing, AIDS\\nis considered an incurable disease, although with\\nproper medical treatment, some people with AIDS\\nmay live for many years.\\nWhere did this virus come from? The latest\\nresearch suggests that HIV evolved from a harmless\\nchimpanzee virus in Africa sometime during the\\n1930s. Spread of the virus was very slow at ﬁrst,\\nand only when air travel became commonplace did\\nthe virus spread worldwide.\\nThe incubation period of AIDS is highly variable,\\nranging from a few months to several years.\\nAn infected person may unknowingly spread HIV to\\nothers before any symptoms appear.

The antigen–antibody complex also stim-\\nulates the process of complement ﬁxation (see Box\\n14–3: Diagnostic T ests).\\nSome of the circulating complement proteins are\\nactivated, or ﬁxed, by an antigen–antibody complex.\\nComplement ﬁxation may be complete or partial. If\\nthe foreign antigen is cellular, the complement pro-\\nteins bond to the antigen–antibody complex, then to\\none another, forming an enzymatic ring that punches\\na hole in the cell to bring about the death of the cell.\\nThis is complete (or entire) complement ﬁxation and\\nis what happens to bacterial cells (it is also the cause of\\nhemolysis in a transfusion reaction).\\nIf the foreign antigen is not a cell—let’s say it’s a\\nvirus for example—partial complement ﬁxation takes\\nplace, in which some of the complement proteins bond\\nto the antigen–antibody complex. This is a chemotac-\\ntic factor. Chemotaxis means “chemical movement” and\\nis actually another label that attracts macrophages to\\nengulf and destroy the foreign antigen.\\nIn summary, adaptive immunity is very speciﬁc,\\ndoes create memory, and because it does, often be-\\ncomes more efficient with repeated exposures.\\nAntibody Responses\\nThe ﬁrst exposure to a foreign antigen does stimulate\\nantibody production, but antibodies are produced\\nslowly and in small amounts (see Fig. 14–9). Let us\\ntake as a speciﬁc example the measles virus. On a per-\\nson’s ﬁrst exposure to this virus, antibody production is\\nusually too slow to prevent the disease itself, and the\\nperson will have clinical measles. Most people who get\\nmeasles recover, and upon recovery have antibodies\\nand memory cells that are speciﬁc for the measles\\nvirus.\\nOn a second exposure to this virus, the memory\\ncells initiate rapid production of large amounts of anti-\\nbodies, enough to prevent a second case of measles.\\nThis is the reason why we develop immunity to certain\\ndiseases, and this is also the basis for the protection\\ngiven by vaccines (see Box 14–4: Vaccines).\\nAs mentioned previously, antibodies label patho-\\ngens or other foreign antigens for phagocytosis or\\ncomplement ﬁxation. More speciﬁcally, antibodies\\ncause agglutination or neutralization of pathogens\\nbefore their eventual destruction. Agglutination\\nmeans “clumping,” and this is what happens when\\nantibodies bind to bacterial cells. The bacteria that are\\nclumped together by attached antibodies are more eas-\\nily phagocytized by macrophages (see Fig. 14–8).\\nThe activity of viruses may be neutralized by anti-\\nbodies. A virus must get inside a living cell in order to\\nreproduce itself. However, a virus with antibodies\\nattached to it is unable to enter a cell, cannot repro-\\nduce, and will soon be phagocytized. Bacterial toxins\\nmay also be neutralized by attached antibodies. The\\nantibodies change the shape of the toxin, prevent it\\nfrom exerting its harmful effects, and promote its\\nphagocytosis by macrophages.\\nAllergies are also the result of antibody activity\\n(see box 14–5: Allergies).\\nTYPES OF IMMUNITY\\nIf we consider the source of immunity, that is, where\\nit comes from, we can begin with two major cate-\\ngories: genetic immunity and acquired immunity.\\nGenetic immunity is conferred by our DNA, and\\nacquired immunity is developed or acquired by natu-\\nral or artiﬁcial means.\\nGenetic immunity does not involve antibodies or\\nthe immune system; it is the result of our genetic\\nmakeup.

These vaccines cannot cause dis-\\nease because the capsules are non-toxic and non-\\nliving; there is nothing that can reproduce.\\nInﬂuenza and rabies vaccines contain killed viruses.\\nMeasles and the oral polio vaccines contain attenu-\\nated (weakened) viruses.\\nAlthough attenuated pathogens are usually\\nstrongly antigenic and stimulate a protective\\nimmune response, there is a very small chance that\\nthe pathogen may regain its virulence and cause\\nthe disease. The live-virus oral polio vaccine (still\\nbeing used in the quest to eliminate polio through-\\nout the world) has a risk of 1 in 500,000 of causing\\npolio. The killed-virus injectable polio vaccine has\\nno such risk.\\nThe purpose of vaccines is to prevent disease. A vac-\\ncine contains an antigen that the immune system\\nwill respond to, just as it would to the actual\\npathogen. The types of vaccine antigens are a killed\\nor weakened ( attenuated) pathogen, part of a\\npathogen such as a bacterial capsule, or an inacti-\\nvated bacterial toxin called a toxoid.\\nBecause the vaccine itself does not cause disease\\n(with very rare exceptions), the fact that antibody\\nproduction to it is slow is not detrimental to the\\nperson.

Because this is a genetic character-\\nistic programmed in DNA, genetic immunity always\\nlasts a lifetime.\\nAcquired immunity does involve antibodies.\\nPassive immunity means that the antibodies are from\\nanother source, whereas active immunity means that\\nthe individual produces his or her own antibodies.\\nOne type of naturally acquired passive immunity is\\nthe placental transmission of antibodies (IgG) from\\nmaternal blood to fetal circulation. The baby will then\\nbe born temporarily immune to the diseases the\\nmother is immune to. Such passive immunity may be\\nprolonged by breast-feeding, because breast milk also\\ncontains maternal antibodies (IgA).\\nArtiﬁcially acquired passive immunity is obtained\\nby the injection of immune globulins (gamma globu-\\nlins or preformed antibodies) after presumed exposure\\nto a particular pathogen. Such immune globulins are\\navailable for German measles, hepatitis A and B,\\ntetanus and botulism (anti-toxins), and rabies. These\\nare not vaccines; they do not stimulate immune mech-\\nanisms, but rather provide immediate antibody pro-\\ntection. Passive immunity is always temporary, lasting\\na few weeks to a few months, because antibodies from\\nanother source eventually break down.\\nActive immunity is the production of one’s own\\nantibodies and may be stimulated by natural or artiﬁ-\\ncial means. Naturally acquired active immunity means\\nthat a person has recovered from a disease and now\\nhas antibodies and memory cells speciﬁc for that\\npathogen. Artiﬁcially acquired active immunity is the\\nresult of a vaccine that has stimulated production of\\nantibodies and memory cells (see Box 14–6: Vaccines\\nThat Have Changed Our Lives). No general state-\\nment can be made about the duration of active immu-\\nnity. Recovering from plague, for example, confers\\nlifelong immunity, but the plague vaccine does not.\\nDuration of active immunity, therefore, varies with\\nthe particular disease or vaccine.\\nThe types of immunity are summarized in T able\\n14–2.\\n336 The Lymphatic System and Immunity\\nBOX 14–5 ALLERGIES\\nIn an allergic reaction, the effects of inﬂamma-\\ntory chemicals create symptoms such as watery\\neyes and runny nose (hay fever) or the more serious\\nwheezing and difficult breathing that characterize\\nasthma.

On the ﬁrst exposure, the\\nperson becomes highly sensitized to the foreign\\nantigen. On the second exposure, histamine is\\nreleased from mast cells throughout the body and\\ncauses a drastic decrease in blood volume. The\\nresulting drop in blood pressure may be fatal in\\nonly a few minutes. People who know they are\\nallergic to bee stings, for example, may obtain a\\nself-contained syringe of epinephrine to carry with\\nthem. Epinephrine can delay the progression of\\nanaphylactic shock long enough for the person to\\nseek medical attention.\\nAn allergy is a hypersensitivity to a particular for-\\neign antigen, called an allergen. Allergens include\\nplant pollens, foods, chemicals in cosmetics, antibi-\\notics such as penicillin, dust, and mold spores. Such\\nallergens are not themselves harmful. Most people,\\nfor example, can inhale pollen, eat peanuts, or take\\npenicillin with no ill effects.\\nHypersensitivity means that the immune system\\noverresponds to the allergen, and produces tissue\\ndamage by doing so. Allergic responses are charac-\\nterized by the production of IgE antibodies, which\\nbond to mast cells. Mast cells are specialized con-\\nnective tissue cells and are numerous in the con-\\nnective tissue of the skin and mucous membranes.\\nChemicals in mast cells include histamine and\\nleukotrienes, which are released by the bonding of\\nIgE antibodies or when tissue damage occurs.\\nThese chemicals contribute to the process of\\ninﬂammation by increasing the permeability of cap-\\nillaries and venules.

We rarely think about breathing, and it isn’t\\nsomething we look forward to, as we might look for-\\nward to a good dinner. We just breathe, usually at the\\nrate of 12 to 20 times per minute, and faster when\\nnecessary (such as during exercise). Y ou may have\\nheard of trained singers “learning how to breathe,”\\nbut they are really learning how to make their breath-\\ning more efficient.\\nMost of the respiratory system is concerned with\\nwhat we think of as breathing: moving air into and out\\nof the lungs. The lungs are the site of the exchanges of\\noxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the\\nblood. Both of these exchanges are important. All\\nof our cells must obtain oxygen to carry out cell respi-\\nration to produce ATP . Just as crucial is the elimina-\\ntion of the CO\\n2 produced as a waste product of cell\\nrespiration, and, as you already know, the proper func-\\ntioning of the circulatory system is essential for the\\ntransport of these gases in the blood.\\nDIVISIONS OF THE\\nRESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\nThe respiratory system may be divided into the upper\\nrespiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The\\nupper respiratory tract consists of the parts outside\\nthe chest cavity: the air passages of the nose, nasal cav-\\nities, pharynx, larynx, and upper trachea. The lower\\nrespiratory tract consists of the parts found within\\nthe chest cavity: the lower trachea and the lungs them-\\nselves, which include the bronchial tubes and alveoli.\\nAlso part of the respiratory system are the pleural\\nmembranes and the respiratory muscles that form the\\nchest cavity: the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.\\nHave you recognized some familiar organs and\\nstructures thus far? There will be more, because this\\nchapter includes material from all of the previous\\nchapters. Even though we are discussing the body\\nsystem by system, the respiratory system is an excel-\\nlent example of the interdependent functioning of all\\nthe body systems.\\nNOSE AND NASAL CAVITIES\\nAir enters and leaves the respiratory system through\\nthe nose, which is made of bone and cartilage covered\\nwith skin. Just inside the nostrils are hairs, which help\\nblock the entry of dust.\\nThe two nasal cavities are within the skull, sepa-\\nrated by the nasal septum, which is a bony plate made\\nof the ethmoid bone and vomer. The nasal mucosa\\n(lining) is ciliated epithelium, with goblet cells that\\nproduce mucus. Three shelf-like or scroll-like bones\\ncalled conchae project from the lateral wall of each\\nnasal cavity (Figs. 15–1 and 6–6). Just as shelves in a\\ncabinet provide more ﬂat space for storage, the con-\\nchae increase the surface area of the nasal mucosa. As\\nair passes through the nasal cavities it is warmed and\\nhumidiﬁed, so that air that reaches the lungs is warm\\nand moist. Bacteria and particles of air pollution are\\ntrapped on the mucus; the cilia continuously sweep\\nthe mucus toward the pharynx. Most of this mucus is\\neventually swallowed, and most bacteria present will\\nbe destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in the gastric\\njuice.\\nIn the upper nasal cavities are the olfactory recep-\\ntors, which detect vaporized chemicals that have been\\ninhaled. The olfactory nerves pass through the eth-\\nmoid bone to the brain.\\nY ou may also recall our earlier discussion of the\\nparanasal sinuses, air cavities in the maxillae, frontal,\\nsphenoid, and ethmoid bones (see Figs. 15–1 and 6–9).\\nThese sinuses are lined with ciliated epithelium, and\\nthe mucus produced drains into the nasal cavities. The\\nfunctions of the paranasal sinuses are to lighten the\\nskull and provide resonance (more vibrating air) for\\nthe voice.\\nPHARYNX\\nThe pharynx is a muscular tube posterior to the nasal\\nand oral cavities and anterior to the cervical vertebrae.\\nFor descriptive purposes, the pharynx may be divided\\ninto three parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and\\nlaryngopharynx (see Fig. 15–1).\\nThe uppermost portion is the nasopharynx, which\\nis behind the nasal cavities. The soft palate is elevated\\nduring swallowing to block the nasopharynx and pre-\\nvent food or saliva from going up rather than down.\\nThe uvula is the part of the soft palate you can see at\\nthe back of the throat. On the posterior wall of the\\nnasopharynx is the adenoid or pharyngeal tonsil, a\\nlymph nodule that contains macrophages. Opening\\ninto the nasopharynx are the two eustachian tubes,\\nwhich extend to the middle ear cavities.

It opens anteriorly into the larynx and\\nposteriorly into the esophagus. Contraction of the\\nmuscular wall of the oropharynx and laryngopharynx\\nis part of the swallowing reﬂex.\\nLARYNX\\nThe larynx is often called the voice box, a name that\\nindicates one of its functions, which is speaking. The\\nother function of the larynx is to be an air passageway\\nbetween the pharynx and the trachea. Air passages\\nmust be kept open at all times, and so the larynx is\\nmade of nine pieces of cartilage connected by liga-\\nments. Cartilage is a ﬁrm yet ﬂexible tissue that pre-\\nvents collapse of the larynx. In comparison, the\\nesophagus is a collapsed tube except when food is pass-\\ning through it.\\nThe largest cartilage of the larynx is the thyroid\\ncartilage (Fig. 15–2), which you can feel on the ante-\\nrior surface of your neck. The epiglottis is the upper-\\nmost cartilage. During swallowing, the larynx is\\nelevated, and the epiglottis closes over the top, rather\\nlike a trap door or hinged lid, to prevent the entry of\\nsaliva or food into the larynx.\\nThe mucosa of the larynx is ciliated epithelium,\\nexcept for the vocal cords (stratiﬁed squamous epithe-\\nlium). The cilia of the mucosa sweep upward to\\nremove mucus and trapped dust and microorganisms.\\nThe vocal cords (or vocal folds) are on either side\\nof the glottis, the opening between them. During\\nbreathing, the vocal cords are held at the sides of the\\nglottis, so that air passes freely into and out of the tra-\\nchea (Fig. 15–3). During speaking, the intrinsic mus-\\ncles of the larynx pull the vocal cords across the glottis,\\nand exhaled air vibrates the vocal cords to produce\\nsounds that can be turned into speech. It is also phys-\\nically possible to speak while inhaling, but this is not\\nwhat we are used to. The cranial nerves that are motor\\nnerves to the larynx for speaking are the vagus and\\naccessory nerves. Y ou may also recall that for most\\npeople, the speech areas are in the left cerebral hemi-\\nsphere.\\nTRACHEA AND BRONCHIAL TREE\\nThe trachea is about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) long\\nand extends from the larynx to the primary bronchi.\\nThe wall of the trachea contains 16 to 20 C-shaped\\npieces of cartilage, which keep the trachea open. The\\ngaps in these incomplete cartilage rings are posterior,\\nto permit the expansion of the esophagus when food is\\nswallowed. The mucosa of the trachea is ciliated\\nepithelium with goblet cells. As in the larynx, the cilia\\nsweep upward toward the pharynx.\\nThe right and left primary bronchi (Fig. 15–4) are\\nthe branches of the trachea that enter the lungs. Their\\nstructure is just like that of the trachea, with C-shaped\\ncartilages and ciliated epithelium. Within the lungs,\\neach primary bronchus branches into secondary\\nbronchi leading to the lobes of each lung (three right,\\ntwo left). The further branching of the bronchial tubes\\nis often called the bronchial tree. Imagine the trachea\\nas the trunk of an upside-down tree with extensive\\nbranches that become smaller and smaller; these\\nsmaller branches are the bronchioles. No cartilage is\\npresent in the walls of the bronchioles; this becomes\\nclinically important in asthma (see Box 15–1: Asthma).\\nThe smallest bronchioles terminate in clusters of alve-\\noli, the air sacs of the lungs.\\nLUNGS AND PLEURAL MEMBRANES\\nThe lungs are located on either side of the heart in\\nthe chest cavity and are encircled and protected by the\\n346 The Respiratory System\\nEpiglottis\\nHyoid\\nbone\\nThyroid\\ncartilage\\nVocal\\ncords\\nCricoid\\ncartilage\\nTracheal\\ncartilages\\nA B\\nFigure 15–2.

The base of each lung rests on the diaphragm\\nbelow; the apex (superior tip) is at the level of the clav-\\nicle. On the medial surface of each lung is an indenta-\\ntion called the hilus, where the primary bronchus and\\nthe pulmonary artery and veins enter the lung.\\nThe pleural membranes are the serous membranes\\nof the thoracic cavity. The parietal pleura lines the\\nchest wall, and the visceral pleura is on the surface of\\nthe lungs. Between the pleural membranes is serous\\nﬂuid, which prevents friction and keeps the two mem-\\nbranes together during breathing.\\nAlveoli\\nThe functional units of the lungs are the air sacs called\\nalveoli. The ﬂat alveolar type I cells that form most of\\nthe alveolar walls are simple squamous epithelium. In\\nthe spaces between clusters of alveoli is elastic con-\\nnective tissue, which is important for exhalation.\\nWithin the alveoli are macrophages that phagocytize\\npathogens or other foreign material that may not have\\nbeen swept out by the ciliated epithelium of the\\nbronchial tree. There are millions of alveoli in each\\nlung, and their total surface area is estimated to be 700\\nto 800 square feet (picture a sidewalk two and a half\\nfeet wide that is as long as an American football ﬁeld,\\nor a rectangle 25 feet by 30 feet). Each alveolus is sur-\\nrounded by a network of pulmonary capillaries (see\\nFig 15–4). Recall that capillaries are also made of sim-\\nple squamous epithelium, so there are only two cells\\nbetween the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pul-\\nmonary capillaries, which permits efficient diffusion of\\ngases (Fig. 15–5).\\nEach alveolus is lined with a thin layer of tissue\\nﬂuid, which is essential for the diffusion of gases, be-\\ncause a gas must dissolve in a liquid in order to enter\\nor leave a cell (the earthworm principle—an earth-\\nworm breathes through its moist skin, and will suffo-\\ncate if its skin dries out). Although this tissue ﬂuid is\\nnecessary, it creates a potential problem in that it\\nwould make the walls of an alveolus stick together\\ninternally. Imagine a plastic bag that is wet inside; its\\nwalls would stick together because of the surface ten-\\nsion of the water. This is just what would happen in\\nalveoli, and inﬂation would be very difficult.\\nThis problem is overcome by pulmonary surfac-\\ntant, a lipoprotein secreted by alveolar type II cells,\\nalso called septal cells. Surfactant mixes with the tissue\\nﬂuid within the alveoli and decreases its surface ten-\\nsion, permitting inﬂation of the alveoli (see Box 15–2:\\nHyaline Membrane Disease). Normal inﬂation of the\\nalveoli in turn permits the exchange of gases, but\\nbefore we discuss this process, we will ﬁrst see how air\\ngets into and out of the lungs.\\nMECHANISM OF BREATHING\\nVentilationis the term for the movement of air to and\\nfrom the alveoli.

The serous\\nﬂuid, however, prevents actual separation of the\\npleural membranes (see Box 15–3: Pneumothorax).\\n3. Intrapulmonic pressure—the pressure within the\\nbronchial tree and alveoli. This pressure ﬂuctuates\\nbelow and above atmospheric pressure during each\\ncycle of breathing.\\nINHALATION\\nInhalation, also called inspiration , is a precise\\nsequence of events that may be described as follows:\\nMotor impulses from the medulla travel along the\\nphrenic nerves to the diaphragm and along the inter-\\ncostal nerves to the external intercostal muscles. The\\ndiaphragm contracts, moves downward, and expands\\nthe chest cavity from top to bottom. The external\\nintercostal muscles pull the ribs up and out, which\\nexpands the chest cavity from side to side and front to\\nback.\\nAs the chest cavity is expanded, the parietal pleura\\nexpands with it. Intrapleural pressure becomes even\\nmore negative as a sort of suction is created between\\nthe pleural membranes. The adhesion created by the\\nserous ﬂuid, however, permits the visceral pleura to be\\nexpanded too, and this expands the lungs as well.\\nAs the lungs expand, intrapulmonic pressure falls\\nbelow atmospheric pressure, and air enters the nose\\nand travels through the respiratory passages to the\\nalveoli. Entry of air continues until intrapulmonic\\npressure is equal to atmospheric pressure; this is a nor-\\nmal inhalation. Of course, inhalation can be continued\\nbeyond normal, that is, a deep breath. This requires a\\nmore forceful contraction of the respiratory muscles\\nto further expand the lungs, permitting the entry of\\nmore air.\\nEXHALATION\\nExhalation may also be called expiration and begins\\nwhen motor impulses from the medulla decrease and\\nthe diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax.\\nAs the chest cavity becomes smaller, the lungs are\\ncompressed, and their elastic connective tissue, which\\nwas stretched during inhalation, recoils and also com-\\nThe Respiratory System 349\\nBOX 15–1 ASTHMA\\nemphysema. When obstructed bronchioles prevent\\nventilation of alveoli, the walls of the alveoli begin\\nto deteriorate and break down, leaving large cavi-\\nties that do not provide much surface area for gas\\nexchange.\\nOne possible way to prevent such serious lung\\ndamage is to prevent asthma attacks with a med-\\nication that blocks the release of IgE antibodies.

If the\\nleft ventricle does not pump strongly, the chamber\\ndoes not empty as it should and cannot receive all\\nthe blood ﬂowing in from the left atrium. Blood\\nﬂow, therefore, is “congested,” and blood backs up\\nin the pulmonary veins and then in the pulmonary\\nBOX 15–7 PNEUMONIA\\nthat accumulates in the air sacs.

When the blood reaches the lungs, an\\narea of lower P CO2, these reactions are reversed, and\\nCO2 is re-formed and diffuses into the alveoli to be\\nexhaled.\\nREGULATION OF RESPIRATION\\nT wo types of mechanisms regulate breathing: nervous\\nmechanisms and chemical mechanisms. Because any\\nchanges in the rate or depth of breathing are ulti-\\nmately brought about by nerve impulses, we will con-\\nsider nervous mechanisms ﬁrst.\\nNERVOUS REGULATION\\nThe respiratory centers are located in the medulla\\nand pons, which are parts of the brain stem (see Fig.\\n15–9). Within the medulla are the inspiration center\\nand expiration center.\\nThe inspiration center automatically generates\\nimpulses in rhythmic spurts. These impulses travel\\nalong nerves to the respiratory muscles to stimulate\\ntheir contraction. The result is inhalation. As the\\nlungs inﬂate, baroreceptors in lung tissue detect this\\nstretching and generate sensory impulses to the\\nmedulla; these impulses begin to depress the inspira-\\ntion center. This is called the Hering-Breuer inﬂation\\nreﬂex, which also helps prevent overinﬂation of the\\nlungs.\\nAs the inspiration center is depressed, the result is\\na decrease in impulses to the respiratory muscles,\\nwhich relax to bring about exhalation. Then the inspi-\\nration center becomes active again to begin another\\ncycle of breathing. When there is a need for more\\nforceful exhalations, such as during exercise, the inspi-\\nration center activates the expiration center , which\\ngenerates impulses to the internal intercostal and\\nabdominal muscles.\\nThe two respiratory centers in the pons work with\\nthe inspiration center to produce a normal rhythm of\\nbreathing. The apneustic center prolongs inhalation,\\nand is then interrupted by impulses from the pneu-\\nmotaxic center, which contributes to exhalation. In\\nnormal breathing, inhalation lasts 1 to 2 seconds, fol-\\nlowed by a slightly longer (2 to 3 seconds) exhalation,\\nproducing the normal respiratory rate range of 12 to\\n20 breaths per minute.\\nWhat has just been described is normal breathing,\\nbut variations are possible and quite common. Emo-\\ntions often affect respiration; a sudden fright may bring\\nabout a gasp or a scream, and anger usually increases\\nthe respiratory rate. In these situations, impulses from\\nthe hypothalamus modify the output from the\\nmedulla. The cerebral cortex enables us to voluntar-\\nily change our breathing rate or rhythm to talk, sing,\\nbreathe faster or slower, or even to stop breathing for\\n1 or 2 minutes. Such changes cannot be continued\\nindeﬁnitely, however, and the medulla will eventually\\nresume control.\\nCoughing and sneezing are reﬂexes that remove\\nirritants from the respiratory passages; the medulla\\ncontains the centers for both of these reﬂexes. Sneez-\\ning is stimulated by an irritation of the nasal mucosa,\\nand coughing is stimulated by irritation of the mucosa\\nof the pharynx, larynx, or trachea. The reﬂex action is\\nessentially the same for both: An inhalation is followed\\nby exhalation beginning with the glottis closed to\\nbuild up pressure. Then the glottis opens suddenly,\\nand the exhalation is explosive. A cough directs the\\nexhalation out the mouth, while a sneeze directs the\\nexhalation out the nose.\\n358 The Respiratory System\\n15Scanlon(p3)-ch15  8/17/06  10:57 AM  Page 358'),\n",

The sensory impulses generated by\\nthese receptors travel along the glossopharyngeal and\\nvagus nerves to the medulla, which responds by\\nincreasing respiratory rate or depth (or both). This\\nresponse will bring more air into the lungs so that\\nmore oxygen can diffuse into the blood to correct the\\nhypoxic state.\\nCarbon dioxide becomes a problem when it is pres-\\nent in excess in the blood, because excess CO\\n2 (hyper-\\ncapnia) lowers the pH when it reacts with water to\\nform carbonic acid (a source of H + ions). That is,\\nexcess CO2 makes the blood or other body ﬂuids less\\nalkaline (or more acidic). The medulla contains\\nchemoreceptors that are very sensitive to changes\\nin pH, especially decreases. If accumulating CO2 low-\\ners blood pH, the medulla responds by increasing res-\\npiration. This is not for the purpose of inhaling, but\\nrather to exhale more CO\\n2 to raise the pH back to\\nnormal.\\nOf the two respiratory gases, which is the more\\nimportant as a regulator of respiration? Our guess\\nmight be oxygen, because it is essential for energy pro-\\nduction in cell respiration. However, the respiratory\\nsystem can maintain a normal blood level of oxygen\\neven if breathing decreases to half the normal rate or\\nstops for a few moments. Recall that exhaled air is\\n16% oxygen. This oxygen did not enter the blood but\\nwas available to do so if needed. Also, the residual air\\nin the lungs supplies oxygen to the blood even if\\nbreathing rate slows.\\nTherefore, carbon dioxide must be the major regu-\\nlator of respiration, and the reason is that carbon diox-\\nide affects the pH of the blood. As was just mentioned,\\nan excess of CO\\n2 causes the blood pH to decrease, a\\nprocess that must not be allowed to continue.\\nTherefore, any increase in the blood CO\\n2 level is\\nquickly compensated for by increased breathing to\\nexhale more CO\\n2. If, for example, you hold your\\nbreath, what is it that makes you breathe again? Have\\nyou run out of oxygen? Probably not, for the reasons\\nmentioned. What has happened is that accumulating\\nCO\\n2 has lowered blood pH enough to stimulate the\\nmedulla to start the breathing cycle again.\\nIn some situations, oxygen does become the major\\nregulator of respiration. People with severe, chronic\\npulmonary diseases such as emphysema have de-\\ncreased exchange of both oxygen and carbon dioxide\\nin the lungs. The decrease in pH caused by accumu-\\nlating CO\\n2 is corrected by the kidneys, but the blood\\noxygen level keeps decreasing. Eventually, the oxygen\\nlevel may fall so low that it does provide a very strong\\nstimulus to increase the rate and depth of respiration.\\nRESPIRATION AND\\nACID–BASE BALANCE\\nAs you have just seen, respiration affects the pH of\\nbody ﬂuids because it regulates the amount of carbon\\n360 The Respiratory System\\nChemoreceptors\\nin carotid and\\naortic bodies\\nChemoreceptors\\nin medulla\\nO\\n2\\nCO2 or\\npH\\nMedulla;\\ninspiration\\ncenter\\nIncrease rate\\nand depth of\\nrespiration\\nMore O\\n2 available\\nto enter blood\\nMore CO2 exhaled\\npH\\nFigure 15–10.

The excess CO\\n2\\nresults in the formation of more H + ions, which\\ndecrease the pH. Holding one’s breath can bring about\\na mild respiratory acidosis, which will soon stimulate\\nthe medulla to initiate breathing again. More serious\\ncauses of respiratory acidosis are pulmonary diseases\\nsuch as pneumonia and emphysema, or severe asthma.\\nEach of these impairs gas exchange and allows excess\\nCO\\n2 to remain in body ﬂuids.\\nRespiratory alkalosis occurs when the rate of res-\\npiration increases, and CO 2 is very rapidly exhaled.\\nLess CO2 decreases H+ ion formation, which increases\\nthe pH. Breathing faster for a few minutes can bring\\nabout a mild state of respiratory alkalosis. Babies who\\ncry for extended periods (crying is a noisy exhalation)\\nput themselves in this condition. In general, however,\\nrespiratory alkalosis is not a common occurrence.\\nSevere physical trauma and shock, or certain states\\nof mental or emotional anxiety, may be accompanied\\nby hyperventilation and also result in respiratory\\nalkalosis. In addition, traveling to a higher altitude\\n(less oxygen in the atmosphere) may cause a tempo-\\nrary increase in breathing rate before compensation\\noccurs (increased rate of RBC production—see\\nChapter 11).\\nRESPIRATORY COMPENSATION\\nIf a pH imbalance is caused by something other than a\\nchange in respiration, it is called metabolic acidosis or\\nalkalosis. In either case, the change in pH stimulates a\\nchange in respiration that may help restore the pH of\\nbody ﬂuids to normal.\\nMetabolic acidosis may be caused by untreated\\ndiabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis), kidney disease, or\\nsevere diarrhea. In such situations, the H\\n+ ion concen-\\ntration of body ﬂuids is increased. Respiratory com-\\npensation involves an increase in the rate and depth of\\nrespiration to exhale more CO\\n2 to decrease H + ion\\nformation, which will raise the pH toward the normal\\nrange.\\nMetabolic alkalosis is not a common occurrence\\nbut may be caused by ingestion of excessive amounts\\nof alkaline medications such as those used to relieve\\ngastric disturbances. Another possible cause is vomit-\\ning of stomach contents only. In such situations, the\\nH\\n+ ion concentration of body ﬂuids is decreased.\\nRespiratory compensation involves a decrease in res-\\npiration to retain CO\\n2 in the body to increase H + ion\\nformation, which will lower the pH toward the normal\\nrange.\\nRespiratory compensation for an ongoing meta-\\nbolic pH imbalance cannot be complete, because there\\nare limits to the amounts of CO\\n2 that may be exhaled\\nor retained. At most, respiratory compensation is only\\nabout 75% effective. A complete discussion of acid–\\nbase balance is found in Chapter 19.\\nAGING AND THE\\nRESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\nPerhaps the most important way to help your respira-\\ntory system age gracefully is not to smoke. In the\\nabsence of chemical assault, respiratory function does\\ndiminish but usually remains adequate. The respira-\\ntory muscles, like all skeletal muscles, weaken with\\nage. Lung tissue loses its elasticity and alveoli are\\nlost as their walls deteriorate. All of this results in de-\\ncreased ventilation and lung capacity, but the remain-\\ning capacity is usually sufficient for ordinary activities.\\nThe cilia of the respiratory mucosa deteriorate with\\nage, and the alveolar macrophages are not as efficient,\\nwhich make elderly people more prone to pneumonia,\\na serious pulmonary infection.\\nChronic alveolar hypoxia from diseases such as\\nemphysema or chronic bronchitis may lead to pul-\\nmonary hypertension, which in turn overworks the\\nright ventricle of the heart. Systemic hypertension\\noften weakens the left ventricle of the heart, leading to\\ncongestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, in\\nwhich excess tissue ﬂuid collects in the alveoli and\\ndecreases gas exchange.

A\\ngas will diffuse from an area of higher partial pres-\\nsure to an area of lower partial pressure.\\n5.

Oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (Sa O2) is 95% to\\n97% in systemic arteries and averages 70% to 75%\\nin systemic veins.\\n4. Most CO\\n2 is carried as HCO 3\\n– ions in blood\\nplasma. CO2 enters the RBCs and reacts with H2O\\nto form carbonic acid (H 2CO3). Carbonic anhy-\\ndrase is the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction.\\nH\\n2CO3 dissociates to H + ions and HCO 3\\n– ions.\\nThe HCO 3\\n– ions leave the RBCs and enter the\\nplasma; Hb buffers the H + ions that remain in the\\nRBCs.

The expiration center is stimulated by the inspi-\\nration center when forceful exhalations are needed.\\n5. In the pons: the apneustic center prolongs inhala-\\ntion, and the pneumotaxic center helps bring about\\nexhalation. These centers work with the inspiration\\ncenter in the medulla to produce a normal breath-\\ning rhythm.\\n6. The hypothalamus inﬂuences changes in breathing\\nin emotional situations.

Food. We may take food for granted, cele-\\nbrate with it, or wish we wouldn’t eat quite so much of\\nit. Although food is not as immediate a need for\\nhuman beings as is oxygen, it is a very important part\\nof our lives. Food provides the raw materials or nutri-\\nents that cells use to reproduce and to build new tis-\\nsue. The energy needed for cell reproduction and\\ntissue building is released from food in the process of\\ncell respiration. In fact, a supply of nutrients from reg-\\nular food intake is so important that the body can even\\nstore any excess for use later. Those “extra 5 pounds”\\nare often stored fat in adipose tissue.\\nThe food we eat, however, is not in a form that our\\nbody cells can use. A turkey sandwich, for example,\\nconsists of complex proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.\\nThe function of the digestive system is to change\\nthese complex organic nutrient molecules into simple\\norganic and inorganic molecules that can then be\\nabsorbed into the blood or lymph to be transported to\\ncells. In this chapter we will discuss the organs of\\ndigestion and the contribution each makes to diges-\\ntion and absorption.\\nDIVISIONS OF THE\\nDIGESTIVE SYSTEM\\nThe two divisions of the digestive system are the ali-\\nmentary tube and the accessory organs (Fig. 16–1).\\nThe alimentary tube extends from the mouth to the\\nanus. It consists of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus,\\nstomach, small intestine, and large intestine.\\nDigestion takes place within the oral cavity, stomach,\\nand small intestine; most absorption of nutrients takes\\nplace in the small intestine. Undigestible material, pri-\\nmarily cellulose, is eliminated by the large intestine\\n(also called the colon).\\nThe accessory organs of digestion are the teeth,\\ntongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.\\nDigestion does not take place within these organs, but\\neach contributes something to the digestive process.\\nTYPES OF DIGESTION\\nThe food we eat is broken down in two complemen-\\ntary processes: mechanical digestion and chemical\\ndigestion. Mechanical digestionis the physical break-\\ning up of food into smaller pieces. Chewing is an\\nexample of this. As food is broken up, more of its sur-\\nface area is exposed for the action of digestive enzymes.\\nEnzymes are discussed in Chapter 2. The work of the\\ndigestive enzymes is the chemical digestion of bro-\\nken-up food particles, in which complex chemical mol-\\necules are changed into much simpler chemicals that\\nthe body can utilize. Such enzymes are speciﬁc with\\nrespect to the fat, protein, or carbohydrate food mole-\\ncules each can digest. For example, protein-digesting\\nenzymes work only on proteins, not on carbohydrates\\nor fats. Each enzyme is produced by a particular diges-\\ntive organ and functions at a speciﬁc site. However, the\\nenzyme’s site of action may or may not be its site of\\nproduction. These digestive enzymes and their func-\\ntions are discussed in later sections.\\nEND PRODUCTS OF DIGESTION\\nBefore we describe the organs of digestion, let us see\\nwhere the process of digestion will take us, or rather,\\nwill take our food. The three types of complex organic\\nmolecules found in food are carbohydrates, proteins,\\nand fats. Each of these complex molecules is digested\\nto a much more simple substance that the body can\\nthen use. Carbohydrates, such as starches and disac-\\ncharides, are digested to monosaccharides such as glu-\\ncose, fructose, and galactose. Proteins are digested to\\namino acids, and fats are digested to fatty acids and\\nglycerol. Also part of food, and released during diges-\\ntion, are vitamins, minerals, and water.\\nWe will now return to the beginning of the alimen-\\ntary tube and consider the digestive organs and the\\nprocess of digestion.\\nORAL CAVITY\\nFood enters the oral cavity (or buccal cavity) by way\\nof the mouth. The boundaries of the oral cavity are\\nthe hard and soft palates superiorly; the cheeks later-\\nally; and the ﬂoor of the mouth inferiorly. Within the\\noral cavity are the teeth and tongue and the openings\\nof the ducts of the salivary glands.\\nTEETH\\nThe function of the teeth is, of course, chewing. This\\nis the process that mechanically breaks food into\\nsmaller pieces and mixes it with saliva. An individual\\n370 The Digestive System\\n16Scanlon(p3)-ch16  8/17/06  10:59 AM  Page 370'),\n",

A complete set\\nof permanent teeth consists of 32 teeth; the types of\\nteeth are incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The\\nwisdom teeth are the third molars on either side of\\neach jawbone.

In such cases, extrac-\\ntion of a wisdom tooth may be necessary to prevent\\ndamage to other teeth.\\nThe structure of a tooth is shown in Fig. 16–2. The\\ncrown is visible above the gum ( gingiva). The root is\\nenclosed in a socket in the mandible or maxillae. The\\nperiodontal membrane lines the socket and produces\\na bone-like cement that anchors the tooth. The outer-\\nmost layer of the crown is enamel, which is made by\\ncells called ameloblasts. Enamel provides a hard chew-\\ning surface and is more resistant to decay than are\\nother parts of the tooth. Within the enamel is dentin,\\nwhich is very similar to bone and is produced by cells\\ncalled odontoblasts. Dentin also forms the roots of a\\ntooth. The innermost portion of a tooth is the pulp\\ncavity, which contains blood vessels and nerve end-\\nings of the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial). Erosion of\\nthe enamel and dentin layers by bacterial acids (dental\\ncaries or cavities) may result in bacterial invasion of\\nthe pulp cavity and a very painful toothache.\\nTONGUE\\nThe tongue is made of skeletal muscle that is inner-\\nvated by the hypoglossal nerves (12th cranial). On the\\nupper surface of the tongue are small projections\\ncalled papillae, many of which contain taste buds (see\\nalso Chapter 9). The sensory nerves for taste are also\\ncranial nerves: the facial (7th) and glossopharyngeal\\n(9th). As you know, the sense of taste is important\\nbecause it makes eating enjoyable, but the tongue has\\nother functions as well.\\nChewing is efficient because of the action of the\\ntongue in keeping the food between the teeth and\\nmixing it with saliva. Elevation of the tongue is the\\nﬁrst step in swallowing. This is a voluntary action, in\\nwhich the tongue contracts and meets the resistance of\\nthe hard palate. The mass of food, called a bolus, is\\nthus pushed backward toward the pharynx. The\\nremainder of swallowing is a reﬂex, which is described\\nin the section on the pharynx.\\nSALIVARY GLANDS\\nThe digestive secretion in the oral cavity is saliva,\\nproduced by three pairs of salivary glands, which are\\nshown in Fig. 16–3. The parotid glands are just\\nbelow and in front of the ears. The submandibular\\n(also called submaxillary) glands are at the posterior\\ncorners of the mandible, and the sublingual glands\\nare below the ﬂoor of the mouth. Each gland has at\\nleast one duct that takes saliva to the oral cavity.\\nSecretion of saliva is continuous, but the amount\\nvaries in different situations. The presence of food\\n(or anything else) in the mouth increases saliva secre-\\ntion. This is a parasympathetic response mediated\\nby the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. The sight\\nor smell of food also increases secretion of saliva.\\nSympathetic stimulation in stress situations decreases\\nsecretion, making the mouth dry and swallowing\\ndifficult.\\nSaliva is mostly water, which is important to dis-\\nsolve food for tasting and to moisten food for swal-\\nlowing. The digestive enzyme in saliva is salivary\\namylase, which breaks down starch molecules to\\nshorter chains of glucose molecules, or to maltose, a\\ndisaccharide. Most of us, however, do not chew our\\nfood long enough for the action of salivary amylase to\\nbe truly effective. As you will see, another amylase\\nfrom the pancreas is also available to digest starch.\\nT able 16–1 summarizes the functions of digestive\\nsecretions.\\nSaliva is made from blood plasma and thus contains\\nmany of the chemicals that are found in plasma.\\nConsiderable research is focused on detecting in saliva\\nchemical markers for diseases such as cancer, with the\\n372 The Digestive System\\nEnamel\\nDentin\\nPulp\\ncavity\\nGingiva\\n(gum)\\nCementum\\nPeriodontal\\nmembrane\\nBlood vessels\\nCrown\\nNeck\\nRoot\\nNerve\\nFigure 16–2.

No digestion takes\\nplace in the pharynx. Its only related function is swal-\\nlowing, the mechanical movement of food. When the\\nbolus of food is pushed backward by the tongue, the\\nconstrictor muscles of the pharynx contract as part of\\nthe swallowing reﬂex. The reﬂex center for swallow-\\ning is in the medulla, which coordinates the many\\nactions that take place: constriction of the pharynx,\\ncessation of breathing, elevation of the soft palate to\\nblock the nasopharynx, elevation of the larynx and clo-\\nsure of the epiglottis, and peristalsis of the esophagus.\\nAs you can see, swallowing is rather complicated, but\\nbecause it is a reﬂex we don’t have to think about mak-\\ning it happen correctly. T alking or laughing while eat-\\ning, however, may interfere with the reﬂex and cause\\nfood to go into the “wrong pipe,” the larynx. When\\nthat happens, the cough reﬂex is usually effective in\\nclearing the airway.\\nESOPHAGUS\\nThe esophagus is a muscular tube that takes food\\nfrom the pharynx to the stomach; no digestion takes\\nplace here. Peristalsis of the esophagus propels food in\\none direction and ensures that food gets to the stom-\\nach even if the body is horizontal or upside down. At\\nthe junction with the stomach, the lumen (cavity) of\\nthe esophagus is surrounded by the lower esophageal\\nsphincter (LES or cardiac sphincter), a circular\\nsmooth muscle. The LES relaxes to permit food to\\nenter the stomach, then contracts to prevent the\\nbackup of stomach contents. If the LES does not close\\ncompletely, gastric juice may splash up into the esoph-\\nagus; this is a painful condition we call heartburn, or\\ngastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD). Most people\\nexperience heartburn once in a while, and it is merely\\nuncomfortable, but chronic GERD is more serious.\\nThe lining of the esophagus cannot withstand the cor-\\nrosive action of gastric acid and will be damaged, per-\\nhaps resulting in bleeding or even perforation.\\nMedications are available to treat this condition.\\nSTRUCTURAL LAYERS\\nOF THE ALIMENTARY TUBE\\nBefore we continue with our discussion of the organs\\nof digestion, we will ﬁrst examine the typical structure\\nof the alimentary tube.

In the esophagus the\\nepithelium is stratiﬁed squamous epithelium; in the\\nstomach and intestines it is simple columnar epithe-\\nlium. The epithelium secretes mucus, which lubricates\\nthe passage of food, and also secretes the digestive\\nenzymes of the stomach and small intestine. Just\\nbelow the epithelium, within the areolar connective\\ntissue, are lymph nodules that contain lymphocytes to\\nproduce antibodies, and macrophages to phagocytize\\nbacteria or other foreign material that get through the\\nepithelium. The thin layers of smooth muscle create\\nfolds in the mucosa, and ripples, so that all of the\\nepithelial cells are in touch with the contents of the\\norgan. In the stomach and small intestine this is\\nimportant for absorption.\\nSUBMUCOSA\\nThe submucosa is made of areolar connective tissue\\nwith many blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Many\\nmillions of nerve ﬁbers are also present, part of what\\nis called the enteric nervous system, or the “brain of\\nthe gut,” which extends the entire length of the ali-\\nmentary tube. The nerve networks in the submucosa\\nare called Meissner’s plexus (or submucosal plexus),\\nand they innervate the mucosa to regulate secretions.\\nParasympathetic impulses increase secretions, whereas\\nsympathetic impulses decrease secretions. Sensory\\nneurons are also present to the smooth muscle (a\\nstretched or cramping gut is painful), as are motor\\nneurons to blood vessels, to regulate vessel diameter\\nand blood ﬂow.\\nEXTERNAL MUSCLE LAYER\\nThe external muscle layer typically contains two layers\\nof smooth muscle: an inner, circular layer and an outer,\\nlongitudinal layer. Variations from the typical do\\noccur, however. In the esophagus, this layer is striated\\nmuscle in the upper third, which gradually changes to\\nsmooth muscle in the lower portions. The stomach has\\nthree layers of smooth muscle, rather than two.\\nContractions of this muscle layer help break up\\nfood and mix it with digestive juices. The one-way\\ncontractions of peristalsis move the food toward the\\nanus. Auerbach’s plexus (or myenteric plexus) is the\\nportion of the enteric nervous system in this layer, and\\nsome of its millions of neurons are autonomic. Sympa-\\nthetic impulses decrease contractions and peristalsis,\\nwhereas parasympathetic impulses increase contrac-\\ntions and peristalsis, promoting normal digestion. The\\nparasympathetic nerves are the vagus (10th cranial)\\nnerves; they truly live up to the meaning of vagus,\\nwhich is “wanderer.”\\nSEROSA\\nAbove the diaphragm, for the esophagus, the serosa,\\nthe outermost layer, is ﬁbrous connective tissue. Below\\nthe diaphragm, the serosa is the mesentery or visceral\\nperitoneum, a serous membrane. Lining the abdomi-\\nnal cavity is the parietal peritoneum, usually simply\\ncalled the peritoneum. The peritoneum-mesentery is\\nactually one continuous membrane (see Fig. 16–4).\\nThe serous ﬂuid between the peritoneum and mesen-\\ntery prevents friction when the alimentary tube con-\\ntracts and the organs slide against one another.\\nThe preceding descriptions are typical of the layers\\nof the alimentary tube. As noted, variations are possi-\\nble, and any important differences are mentioned in\\nthe sections that follow on speciﬁc organs.\\nSTOMACH\\nThe stomach is located in the upper left quadrant of\\nthe abdominal cavity, to the left of the liver and in\\nfront of the spleen. Although part of the alimentary\\ntube, the stomach is not a tube, but rather a sac that\\nextends from the esophagus to the small intestine.\\nBecause it is a sac, the stomach is a reservoir for food,\\nso that digestion proceeds gradually and we do not\\nhave to eat constantly. Both mechanical and chemical\\ndigestion take place in the stomach.\\nThe parts of the stomach are shown in Fig. 16–5.\\nThe cardiac oriﬁce is the opening of the esophagus,\\nand the fundus is the portion above the level of this\\nopening. The body of the stomach is the large central\\nportion, bounded laterally by the greater curvature and\\nmedially by the lesser curvature. The pylorus is adja-\\ncent to the duodenum of the small intestine, and the\\npyloric sphincter surrounds the junction of the two\\norgans. The fundus and body are mainly storage areas,\\nwhereas most digestion takes place in the pylorus.\\nWhen the stomach is empty, the mucosa appears\\nwrinkled or folded. These folds are called rugae; they\\nﬂatten out as the stomach is ﬁlled and permit expan-\\nsion of the lining without tearing it.

These three layers are inner-\\nvated by the myenteric plexuses of the enteric nervous\\nsystem. Stimulatory impulses are carried from the\\nCNS by the vagus nerves (10th cranial) and provide\\nfor very efficient mechanical digestion to change food\\ninto a thick liquid called chyme. The pyloric sphincter\\nis usually contracted when the stomach is churning\\nfood; it relaxes at intervals to permit small amounts of\\nchyme to pass into the duodenum. This sphincter then\\ncontracts again to prevent the backup of intestinal\\ncontents into the stomach (see Box 16–1: Disorders of\\nthe Stomach).\\nSMALL INTESTINE\\nThe small intestine is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diam-\\neter and approximately 20 feet (6 m) long and extends\\nfrom the stomach to the cecum of the large intestine.\\nWithin the abdominal cavity, the large intestine encir-\\ncles the coils of the small intestine (see Fig. 16–1).\\nThe duodenum is the ﬁrst 10 inches (25 cm) of the\\nsmall intestine. The common bile duct enters the duo-\\ndenum at the ampulla of Vater (or hepatopancreatic\\nampulla). The jejunum is about 8 feet long, and the\\nileum is about 11 feet in length. In a living person,\\nhowever, the small intestine is always contracted and is\\ntherefore somewhat shorter.\\nDigestion is completed in the small intestine, and\\nthe end products of digestion are absorbed into the\\nblood and lymph.

Lymph nodules called Peyer’s patches\\nare especially abundant in the ileum to destroy\\nabsorbed pathogens. The external muscle layer has the\\ntypical circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers\\nthat mix the chyme with digestive secretions and pro-\\npel the chyme toward the colon. Stimulatory impulses\\nto the enteric nerves of these muscle layers are carried\\nby the vagus nerves.

Because the normal stomach lining is\\nadapted to resist the corrosive action of gastric\\njuice, ulcer formation is the result of oversecretion\\nof HCl or undersecretion of mucus.\\nAs erosion reaches the submucosa, small blood\\nvessels are ruptured and bleed. If vomiting occurs,\\nthe vomitus has a “coffee-ground” appearance due\\nto the presence of blood acted on by gastric juice.\\nA more serious complication is perforation of the\\nstomach wall, with leakage of gastric contents into\\nthe abdominal cavity, and peritonitis.\\nThe bacterium called Helicobacter pylori is the\\ncause of most gastric ulcers. For many patients, a\\nfew weeks of antibiotic therapy to eradicate this\\nbacterium has produced rapid healing of their\\nulcers. This bacterium also seems to be responsible\\nfor virtually all cases of stomach cancer.\\nThe medications that decrease the secretion of\\nHCl are useful for ulcer patients not helped by\\nantibiotics.\\nVomiting is the expulsion of stomach and intes-\\ntinal contents through the esophagus and mouth.\\nStimuli include irritation of the stomach, motion\\nsickness, food poisoning, or diseases such as menin-\\ngitis. The vomiting center is in the medulla, which\\ncoordinates the simultaneous contraction of the\\ndiaphragm and the abdominal muscles. This\\nsqueezes the stomach and upper intestine, expell-\\ning their contents. As part of the reﬂex, the lower\\nesophageal sphincter relaxes, and the glottis closes.\\nIf the glottis fails to close, as may happen in alcohol\\nor drug intoxication, aspiration of vomitus may\\noccur and result in fatal obstruction of the respira-\\ntory passages.\\nPyloric stenosis means that the opening of the\\npyloric sphincter is narrowed, and emptying of the\\nstomach is impaired. This is most often a congeni-\\ntal disorder caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric\\nsphincter. For reasons unknown, this condition is\\nmore common in male infants than in female\\ninfants.

We will return to\\nthe small intestine after considering these other\\norgans.\\nLIVER\\nThe liver (Fig. 16–6) consists of two large lobes, right\\nand left, and ﬁlls the upper right and center of the\\nabdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm. The\\nstructural unit of the liver is the liver lobule , a\\nroughly hexagonal column of liver cells (hepatocytes).\\nBetween adjacent lobules are branches of the hepatic\\nartery and portal vein. The capillaries of a lobule are\\nsinusoids, large and very permeable vessels between\\nthe rows of liver cells. The sinusoids receive blood\\nfrom both the hepatic artery and portal vein, and it is\\nwith this mixture of blood that the liver cells carry out\\ntheir functions. The hepatic artery brings oxygenated\\nblood, and the portal vein brings blood from the\\ndigestive organs and spleen (see Fig. 13–7). Each lob-\\nule has a central vein. The central veins of all the lob-\\nules unite to form the hepatic veins, which take blood\\nout of the liver to the inferior vena cava.\\nThe cells of the liver have many functions (which\\nare discussed in a later section), but their only diges-\\ntive function is the production of bile. Bile enters the\\nsmall bile ducts, called bile canaliculi, on the liver\\ncells, which unite to form larger ducts and ﬁnally\\nmerge to form the hepatic duct, which takes bile out\\nof the liver (see Fig. 16–6). The hepatic duct unites\\nwith the cystic duct of the gallbladder to form the\\ncommon bile duct , which takes bile to the duode-\\nnum.\\nBile is mostly water and has an excretory function\\nin that it carries bilirubin and excess cholesterol to the\\nintestines for elimination in feces. The digestive func-\\ntion of bile is accomplished by bile salts, which emul-\\nsify fats in the small intestine. Emulsiﬁcation means\\nthat large fat globules are broken into smaller glob-\\nules. This is mechanical, not chemical, digestion; the\\nfat is still fat but now has more surface area to facili-\\ntate chemical digestion.\\nProduction of bile is stimulated by the hormone\\nsecretin, which is produced by the duodenum when\\nfood enters the small intestine. T able 16–2 summa-\\nThe Digestive System 379\\nrizes the regulation of secretion of all digestive secre-\\ntions.\\nGALLBLADDER\\nThe gallbladder is a sac about 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10\\ncm) long located on the undersurface of the right lobe\\nof the liver. Bile in the hepatic duct of the liver ﬂows\\nthrough the cystic duct into the gallbladder (see Fig.\\n16–6), which stores bile until it is needed in the small\\nintestine. The gallbladder also concentrates bile by\\nabsorbing water (see Box 16–2: Gallstones).\\nWhen fatty foods enter the duodenum, the\\nenteroendocrine cells of the duodenal mucosa secrete\\nthe hormone cholecystokinin. This hormone stimu-\\nlates contraction of the smooth muscle in the wall of\\nthe gallbladder, which forces bile into the cystic duct,\\nthen into the common bile duct, and on into the duo-\\ndenum.\\nPANCREAS\\nThe pancreas is located in the upper left abdominal\\nquadrant between the curve of the duodenum and the\\nspleen and is about 6 inches (15 cm) in length. The\\nendocrine functions of the pancreas were discussed in\\nChapter 10, so only the exocrine functions will be\\nconsidered here. The exocrine glands of the pancreas\\nare called acini (singular: acinus) (Fig. 16–7). They\\nproduce enzymes that are involved in the digestion of\\nall three types of complex food molecules.\\nThe pancreatic enzyme amylase digests starch to\\nmaltose. Y ou may recall that this is the “backup”\\nenzyme for salivary amylase, though pancreatic amy-\\nlase is responsible for most digestion of starch. Lipase\\nconverts emulsiﬁed fats to fatty acids and glycerol.\\nThe emulsifying or fat-separating action of bile salts\\nincreases the surface area of fats so that lipase works\\neffectively. T rypsinogen is an inactive enzyme that is\\nchanged to active trypsin in the duodenum. T rypsin\\ndigests polypeptides to shorter chains of amino acids.\\nThe pancreatic enzyme juice is carried by small\\nducts that unite to form larger ducts, then ﬁnally the\\nmain pancreatic duct. An accessory duct may also be\\npresent. The main pancreatic duct emerges from the\\nmedial side of the pancreas and joins the common bile\\nduct to the duodenum (see Fig. 16–7).\\nThe pancreas also produces a bicarbonate juice\\n(containing sodium bicarbonate), which is alkaline.\\n16Scanlon(p3)-ch16  8/17/06  10:59 AM  Page 379'),\n",

All of these folds greatly\\nincrease the surface area of the intestinal lining. It is\\nestimated that if the intestinal mucosa could be ﬂat-\\ntened out, it would cover more than 2000 square feet\\n(half a basketball court).\\nThe absorption of nutrients takes place from the\\nlumen of the intestine into the vessels within the\\nvilli. Refer to Fig. 16–8 and notice that within each vil-\\nlus is a capillary network and a lacteal, which is a\\ndead-end lymph capillary. Water-soluble nutrients\\nare absorbed into the blood in the capillary networks.\\nMonosaccharides, amino acids, positive ions, and the\\nwater-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B vitamins)\\nare absorbed by active transport.

Certain\\nnutrients have additional special requirements for\\ntheir absorption: For example, vitamin B\\n12 requires\\nthe intrinsic factor produced by the parietal cells\\nof the gastric mucosa, and the efficient absorption of\\ncalcium ions requires parathyroid hormone and vita-\\nmin D.\\nFat-soluble nutrients are absorbed into the lymph\\nin the lacteals of the villi. Bile salts are necessary for\\nthe efficient absorption of fatty acids and the fat-solu-\\nble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Once absorbed, fatty\\nacids are recombined with glycerol to form triglyc-\\nerides. These triglycerides then form globules that\\ninclude cholesterol and protein; these lipid–protein\\ncomplexes are called chylomicrons. In the form of\\nchylomicrons, most absorbed fat is transported by the\\nlymph and eventually enters the blood in the left sub-\\nclavian vein.\\nBlood from the capillary networks in the villi does\\nnot return directly to the heart but ﬁrst travels\\nthrough the portal vein to the liver. Y ou may recall the\\nimportance of portal circulation, discussed in Chapter\\n13. This pathway enables the liver to regulate the\\nblood levels of glucose and amino acids, store certain\\nvitamins, and remove potential poisons from the\\nblood (see Box 16–3: Disorders of the Intestines).\\n384 The Digestive System\\nBOX 16–3 DISORDERS OF THE INTESTINES\\nSalmonella food poisoning is caused by bac-\\nteria in the genus Salmonella. These are part of the\\nintestinal ﬂora of animals, and animal foods such as\\nmeat and eggs may be sources of infection. These\\nbacteria are not normal for people, and they cause\\nthe intestines to secrete large amounts of ﬂuid.\\nSymptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps,\\nand vomiting and usually last only a few days. For\\nelderly or debilitated people, however, salmonella\\nfood poisoning may be very serious or even fatal.\\nDiverticula are small outpouchings through\\nweakened areas of the intestinal wall. They are\\nmore likely to occur in the colon than in the small\\nintestine and may exist for years without causing\\nany symptoms. The presence of diverticula is called\\ndiverticulosis . Inflammation of diverticula is\\ncalled diverticulitis, which is usually the result of\\nentrapment of feces and bacteria. Symptoms\\ninclude abdominal pain and tenderness and fever. If\\nuncomplicated, diverticulitis may be treated with\\nantibiotics and modiﬁcations in diet. The most seri-\\nous complication is perforation of diverticula, allow-\\ning fecal material into the abdominal cavity, causing\\nperitonitis. A diet high in ﬁber is believed to be an\\nimportant aspect of prevention, to provide bulk in\\nthe colon and prevent weakening of its wall.\\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions of the duodenal\\nwall caused by the gastric juice that enters from the\\nstomach. The most serious consequences are bleed-\\ning and perforation.\\nParalytic ileus is the cessation of contraction\\nof the smooth muscle layer of the intestine. This\\nis a possible complication of abdominal surgery,\\nbut it may also be the result of peritonitis or\\ninﬂammation elsewhere in the abdominal cavity.\\nIn the absence of peristalsis, intestinal obstruc-\\ntion may occur. Bowel movements cease, and vom-\\niting occurs to relieve the pressure within the\\nalimentary tube. Treatment involves suctioning\\nthe intestinal contents to eliminate any obstruc-\\ntion and to allow the intestine to regain its normal\\nmotility.\\nLactose intolerance is the inability to digest\\nlactose because of deﬁciency of the enzyme lactase.\\nLactase deﬁciency may be congenital, a conse-\\nquence of prematurity, or acquired later in life. The\\ndelayed form is quite common among people of\\nAfrican or Asian ancestry, and in part is genetic.\\nWhen lactose, or milk sugar, is not digested, it\\nundergoes fermentation in the intestine.

It extends from the ileum of the small\\nintestine to the anus, the terminal opening. The parts\\nof the colon are shown in Fig. 16–9. The cecum is the\\nﬁrst portion, and at its junction with the ileum is\\nthe ileocecal valve, which is not a sphincter but serves\\nthe same purpose. After undigested food (which is\\nnow mostly cellulose) and water pass from the ileum\\ninto the cecum, closure of the ileocecal valve prevents\\nthe backﬂow of fecal material.\\nAttached to the cecum is the appendix, a small,\\ndead-end tube with abundant lymphatic tissue. The\\nappendix seems to be a vestigial organ, that is, one\\nwhose size and function seem to be reduced. Although\\nthere is abundant lymphatic tissue in the wall of the\\nappendix, the possibility that the appendix is con-\\ncerned with immunity is not known with certainty.\\nAppendicitis refers to inﬂammation of the appendix,\\nwhich may occur if fecal material becomes impacted\\nwithin it. This usually necessitates an appendectomy,\\nthe surgical removal of the appendix.\\nThe remainder of the colon consists of the ascend-\\ning, transverse, and descending colon, which encircle\\nthe small intestine; the sigmoid colon, which turns\\nmedially and downward; the rectum; and the anal\\ncanal. The rectum is about 6 inches long, and the anal\\ncanal is the last inch of the colon that surrounds the\\nanus. Clinically, however, the terminal end of the\\ncolon is usually referred to as the rectum.\\nNo digestion takes place in the colon. The only\\nsecretion of the colonic mucosa is mucus, which lubri-\\ncates the passage of fecal material. The longitudinal\\nsmooth muscle layer of the colon is in three bands\\ncalled taeniae coli. The rest of the colon is “gathered”\\nto ﬁt these bands.

Other\\nvitamins produced in smaller amounts include\\nriboﬂavin, thiamin, biotin, and folic acid. Everything\\nabsorbed by the colon circulates ﬁrst to the liver by\\nway of portal circulation.

Elimination\\nof feces is accomplished by the defecation reﬂex , a\\nspinal cord reﬂex that may be controlled voluntarily.\\nThe rectum is usually empty until peristalsis of the\\ncolon pushes feces into it. These waves of peristalsis\\ntend to occur after eating, especially when food enters\\nthe duodenum. The wall of the rectum is stretched by\\nthe entry of feces, and this is the stimulus for the defe-\\ncation reﬂex.\\nStretch receptors in the smooth muscle layer of the\\nrectum generate sensory impulses that travel to the\\nsacral spinal cord. The returning motor impulses\\ncause the smooth muscle of the rectum to contract.\\nSurrounding the anus is the internal anal sphincter,\\nwhich is made of smooth muscle. As part of the reﬂex,\\nthis sphincter relaxes, permitting defecation to take\\nplace.\\nThe external anal sphincter is made of skeletal\\nmuscle and surrounds the internal anal sphincter (Fig.\\n16–10). If defecation must be delayed, the external\\nsphincter may be voluntarily contracted to close the\\nanus. The awareness of the need to defecate passes as\\nthe stretch receptors of the rectum adapt. These\\nreceptors will be stimulated again when the next wave\\nof peristalsis reaches the rectum (see Box 16–5: Fiber).\\nOTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER\\nThe liver is a remarkable organ, and only the brain is\\ncapable of a greater variety of functions. The liver\\ncells (hepatocytes) produce many enzymes that cat-\\nalyze many different chemical reactions. These reac-\\ntions are the functions of the liver. As blood ﬂows\\nthrough the sinusoids (capillaries) of the liver (see Fig.\\n16–6), materials are removed by the liver cells, and the\\nproducts of the liver cells are secreted into the blood.\\nSome of the liver functions will already be familiar\\nto you. Others are mentioned again and discussed in\\nmore detail in the next chapter. Because the liver\\nhas such varied effects on so many body systems, we\\nwill use the categories below to summarize the liver\\nfunctions.\\n1. Carbohydrate metabolism —As you know, the\\nliver regulates the blood glucose level. Excess glu-\\ncose is converted to glycogen (glycogenesis) when\\nblood glucose is high; the hormones insulin and\\ncortisol facilitate this process. During hypo-\\nglycemia or stress situations, glycogen is converted\\nback to glucose (glycogenolysis) to raise the blood\\nglucose level. Epinephrine and glucagon are the\\nhormones that facilitate this process.\\n386 The Digestive System\\nBOX 16–4 INFANT BOTULISM\\nBotulism is most often acquired from food.\\nWhen the spores of the botulism bacteria are in\\nan anaerobic (without oxygen) environment\\nsuch as a can of food, they germinate into active\\nbacteria that produce a neurotoxin. If people\\ningest food containing this toxin, they will\\ndevelop the paralysis that is characteristic of\\nbotulism.\\nFor infants less than 1 year of age, however,\\ningestion of just the bacterial spores may be\\nharmful. The infant’s stomach does not produce\\nmuch HCl, so ingested botulism spores may not\\nbe destroyed. Of equal importance, the infant’s\\nnormal colon ﬂora is not yet established. Without\\nthe normal population of colon bacteria to pro-\\nvide competition, spores of the botulism bacteria\\nmay germinate and produce their toxin.\\nAn affected infant becomes lethargic and\\nweak; paralysis may progress slowly or rapidly.\\nTreatment (antitoxin) is available, but may be\\ndelayed if botulism is not suspected. Many cases\\nof infant botulism have been traced to honey\\nthat was found to contain botulism spores. Such\\nspores are not harmful to older children and\\nadults, who have a normal colon ﬂora that pre-\\nvents the botulism bacteria from becoming\\nestablished.\\n16Scanlon(p3)-ch16  8/17/06  10:59 AM  Page 386'),\n",

Fructose and galactose, for example, are\\nend products of the digestion of sucrose and lac-\\ntose. Because most cells, however, cannot readily\\nuse fructose and galactose as energy sources, they\\nare converted by the liver to glucose, which is eas-\\nily used by cells.\\n2. Amino acid metabolism —The liver regulates\\nblood levels of amino acids based on tissue needs\\nfor protein synthesis. Of the 20 different amino\\nacids needed for the production of human proteins,\\nthe liver is able to synthesize 12, called the non-\\nessential amino acids . The chemical process by\\nwhich this is done is called transamination, the\\ntransfer of an amino group (NH\\n2) from an amino\\nacid present in excess to a free carbon chain that\\nforms a complete, new amino acid molecule. The\\nother eight amino acids, which the liver cannot\\nsynthesize, are called the essential amino acids. In\\nthis case, “essential” means that the amino acids\\nmust be supplied by our food, because the liver\\ncannot manufacture them. Similarly, “non-essen-\\ntial” means that the amino acids do not have to be\\nsupplied in our food because the liver can make\\nthem. All 20 amino acids are required in order to\\nmake our body proteins.\\nExcess amino acids, those not needed right away\\nfor protein synthesis, cannot be stored. However,\\nthey do serve another useful purpose. By the\\nprocess of deamination, which also occurs in the\\nliver, the NH\\n2 group is removed from an amino\\nacid, and the remaining carbon chain may be con-\\nverted to a simple carbohydrate molecule or to fat.\\nThus, excess amino acids are utilized for energy\\nproduction: either for immediate energy or for the\\npotential energy stored as fat in adipose tissue. The\\nNH\\n2 groups that were detached from the original\\namino acids are combined to form urea, a waste\\nproduct that will be removed from the blood by the\\nkidneys and excreted in urine.\\n3. Lipid metabolism—The liver forms lipoproteins,\\nwhich as their name tells us, are molecules of lipids\\nand proteins, for the transport of fats in the blood\\nto other tissues. The liver also synthesizes choles-\\nterol and excretes excess cholesterol into bile to be\\neliminated in feces.\\nFatty acids are a potential source of energy, but\\nin order to be used in cell respiration they must be\\nbroken down to smaller molecules. In the process\\nof beta-oxidation, the long carbon chains of fatty\\nacids are split into two-carbon molecules called\\nacetyl groups, which are simple carbohydrates.\\nThese acetyl groups may be used by the liver cells\\nto produce ATP or may be combined to form\\nketones to be transported in the blood to other\\ncells. These other cells then use the ketones to pro-\\nduce ATP in cell respiration.\\n4. Synthesis of plasma proteins —This is a liver\\nfunction that you will probably remember from\\nChapter 11. The liver synthesizes many of the pro-\\nteins that circulate in the blood. Albumin, the most\\nabundant plasma protein, helps maintain blood vol-\\nume by pulling tissue ﬂuid into capillaries.\\nThe clotting factors are also produced by the\\nliver. These, as you recall, include prothrombin,\\nﬁbrinogen, and Factor 8, which circulate in the\\nblood until needed in the chemical clotting mech-\\nanism. The liver also synthesizes alpha and beta\\nglobulins, which are proteins that serve as carriers\\nfor other molecules, such as fats, in the blood.\\n5. Formation of bilirubin—This is another familiar\\nfunction: The liver contains ﬁxed macrophages\\nthat phagocytize old red blood cells (RBCs).\\nBilirubin is then formed from the heme portion of\\nthe hemoglobin. The liver also removes from the\\nblood the bilirubin formed in the spleen and red\\nbone marrow and excretes it into bile to be elimi-\\nnated in feces.\\n6. Phagocytosis by Kupffer cells —The fixed\\nmacrophages of the liver are called Kupffer cells\\n(or stellate reticuloendothelial cells). Besides\\ndestroying old RBCs, Kupffer cells phagocytize\\npathogens or other foreign material that circulate\\nthrough the liver. Many of the bacteria that get to\\nthe liver come from the colon. These bacteria are\\npart of the normal ﬂora of the colon but would be\\nvery harmful elsewhere in the body. The bacteria\\nthat enter the blood with the water absorbed by the\\ncolon are carried to the liver by way of portal cir-\\nculation. The Kupffer cells in the liver phagocytize\\nand destroy these bacteria, removing them from\\nthe blood before the blood returns to the heart.\\n7. Storage—The liver stores the fat-soluble vitamins\\nA, D, E, and K, and the water-soluble vitamin B\\n12.\\nUp to a 6- to 12-month supply of vitamins A and D\\nmay be stored, and beef or chicken liver is an excel-\\nlent dietary source of these vitamins.\\nAlso stored by the liver are the minerals iron and\\ncopper.

Copper (as well as iron) is\\npart of some of the proteins needed for cell respi-\\nration, and is part of some of the enzymes neces-\\nsary for hemoglobin synthesis.\\n8. Detoxiﬁcation—The liver is capable of synthesiz-\\ning enzymes that will detoxify harmful substances,\\nthat is, change them to less harmful ones. Alcohol,\\nfor example, is changed to acetate, which is a two-\\ncarbon molecule (an acetyl group) that can be used\\nin cell respiration.\\nMedications are all potentially toxic, but the\\nliver produces enzymes that break them down or\\nchange them. When given in a proper dosage, a\\nmedication exerts its therapeutic effect but is then\\nchanged to less active substances that are usually\\nexcreted by the kidneys. An overdose of a drug\\nmeans that there is too much of it for the liver to\\ndetoxify in a given time, and the drug will remain\\nin the body with possibly harmful effects. This is\\nwhy alcohol should never be consumed when tak-\\ning medication. Such a combination may cause the\\nliver’s detoxiﬁcation ability to be overworked and\\nineffective, with the result that both the alcohol\\nand the medication will remain toxic for a longer\\ntime. Barbiturates taken as sleeping pills after con-\\nsumption of alcohol have too often proved fatal for\\njust this reason.\\nAmmonia is a toxic substance produced by the\\nbacteria in the colon. Because it is soluble in water,\\nsome ammonia is absorbed into the blood, but it is\\ncarried ﬁrst to the liver by portal circulation. The\\nliver converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic sub-\\nstance, before the ammonia can circulate and dam-\\nage other organs, especially the brain. The urea\\nformed is excreted by the kidneys (see Box 16–6:\\nHepatitis).\\nAGING AND THE\\nDIGESTIVE SYSTEM\\nMany changes can be expected in the aging digestive\\nsystem.

Of equal importance, carriers are\\nsources of the virus for others, especially their sex-\\nual partners.\\nA vaccine is available for hepatitis B, and health-\\ncare workers who have contact with blood, even\\njust occasional contact, should receive it. Other\\npotential recipients of the vaccine are the sexual\\npartners of carriers. Pediatricians now consider this\\nvaccine one of the standard ones for infants.\\nThe hepatitis C virus is also present in body ﬂu-\\nids and is spread by blood or mucous membrane\\ncontact.

The most common of\\nthese hepatitis viruses have been designated A, B,\\nand C, although there are others. Symptoms of hep-\\natitis include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and possibly\\njaundice. Severity of disease ranges from very mild\\n(even asymptomatic) to fatal.

T ooth structure (see Fig. 16–2)—enamel covers the\\ncrown and provides a hard chewing surface; dentin\\nis within the enamel and forms the roots; the pulp\\ncavity contains blood vessels and endings of the\\ntrigeminal nerve; the periodontal membrane\\nproduces cement to anchor the tooth in the jaw-\\nbone.\\n3. The tongue is skeletal muscle innervated by the\\nhypoglossal nerves. Papillae on the upper surface\\ncontain taste buds (facial and glossopharyngeal\\nnerves). Functions: taste, keeps food between the\\nteeth when chewing, elevates to push food back-\\nward for swallowing.\\n4. Salivary glands—parotid, submandibular, and sub-\\nlingual (see Fig. 16–3); ducts take saliva to the oral\\ncavity.\\n390 The Digestive System\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nperiodontal disease and loss of teeth. Secretions are\\nreduced throughout the digestive system, and the\\neffectiveness of peristalsis diminishes. Indigestion may\\nbecome more frequent, especially if the LES loses its\\ntone, and there is a greater chance of esophageal dam-\\nage. In the colon, diverticula may form; these are bub-\\nble-like outpouchings of the weakened wall of the\\ncolon that may be asymptomatic or become infected.\\nIntestinal obstruction, of the large or small bowel,\\noccurs with greater frequency among the elderly.\\nSluggish peristalsis contributes to constipation, which\\nin turn may contribute to the formation of hemor-\\nrhoids. The risk of oral cancer or colon cancer also\\nincreases with age.\\nThe liver usually continues to function adequately\\neven well into old age, unless damaged by pathogens\\nsuch as the hepatitis viruses or by toxins such as alco-\\nhol. There is a greater tendency for gallstones to form,\\nperhaps necessitating removal of the gallbladder.\\nInﬂammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) is also\\nmore frequent in older adults. In the absence of spe-\\nciﬁc diseases, the pancreas usually functions well,\\nalthough acute pancreatitis of unknown cause is some-\\nwhat more likely in elderly people.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe processes of the digestion of food and the absorp-\\ntion of nutrients enable the body to use complex food\\nmolecules for many purposes. Much of the food we eat\\nliterally becomes part of us. The body synthesizes pro-\\nteins and lipids for the growth and repair of tissues and\\nproduces enzymes to catalyze all of the reactions that\\ncontribute to homeostasis. Some of our food provides\\nthe energy required for growth, repair, movement,\\nsensation, and thinking. In the next chapter we will\\ndiscuss the chemical basis of energy production from\\nfood and consider the relationship of energy produc-\\ntion to the maintenance of body temperature.\\n16Scanlon(p3)-ch16  8/17/06  10:59 AM  Page 390'),\n",

Naturally, we are not aware of the process\\nof cell respiration, but we may be aware of one of the\\nproducts—energy in the form of heat. The human\\nbody is indeed warm, and its temperature is regulated\\nvery precisely. Though we cannot stand barefoot on\\nthe ice of Antarctica for months in winter, as penguins\\ndo, we can adapt to and survive a wide range of envi-\\nronmental temperatures.\\nThis chapter discusses the regulation of body tem-\\nperature and also discusses metabolism, which is the\\ntotal of all reactions that take place within the body.\\nThese reactions include the energy-releasing ones of\\ncell respiration and energy-requiring ones such as\\nprotein synthesis, or DNA synthesis for mitosis. As\\nyou will see, body temperature and metabolism are\\ninseparable.\\nBODY TEMPERATURE\\nThe normal range of human body temperature is\\n96.5° to 99.5 °F (36 ° to 38 °C), with an average oral\\ntemperature of 98.6 °F (37 °C). (A 1992 study sug-\\ngested a slightly lower average oral temperature: 98.2°\\nor 36.8 °. But everyone seems to prefer the “tradi-\\ntional” average temperature.) Within a 24-hour\\nperiod, an individual’s temperature ﬂuctuates 1° to 2°,\\nwith the lowest temperatures occurring during sleep.\\nAt either end of the age spectrum, however, tem-\\nperature regulation may not be as precise as it is in\\nolder children or younger adults. Infants have more\\nsurface area (skin) relative to volume and are likely to\\nlose heat more rapidly. In the elderly, the mechanisms\\nthat maintain body temperature may not function as\\nefficiently as they once did, and changes in environ-\\nmental temperature may not be compensated for as\\nquickly or effectively. This is especially important to\\nremember when caring for patients who are very\\nyoung or very old.\\nHEAT PRODUCTION\\nCell respiration, the process that releases energy from\\nfood to produce ATP , also produces heat as one of its\\nenergy products. Although cell respiration takes place\\nconstantly, many factors inﬂuence the rate of this\\nprocess:\\n1. The hormone thyroxine (and T\\n3), produced by the\\nthyroid gland, increases the rate of cell respiration\\nand heat production. The secretion of thyroxine is\\nregulated by the body’s rate of energy production,\\nthe metabolic rate itself. (See Chapter 10 for a dis-\\ncussion of the feedback mechanism involving the\\nhypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland and\\nChapter 1 for an illustration.) When the metabolic\\nrate decreases, the thyroid gland is stimulated to\\nsecrete more thyroxine. As thyroxine increases the\\nrate of cell respiration, a negative feedback mecha-\\nnism inhibits further secretion until metabolic rate\\ndecreases again. Thus, thyroxine is secreted when-\\never there is a need for increased cell respiration\\nand is probably the most important regulator of\\nday-to-day energy production.\\n2. In stress situations, epinephrine and norepineph-\\nrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla, and the\\nsympathetic nervous system becomes more active.\\nEpinephrine increases the rate of cell respiration,\\nespecially in organs such as the heart, skeletal mus-\\ncles, and liver. Sympathetic stimulation also in-\\ncreases the activity of these organs. The increased\\nproduction of ATP to meet the demands of the\\nstress situation also means that more heat will be\\nproduced.\\n3. Organs that are normally active (producing\\nATP) are signiﬁcant sources of heat when the body\\nis at rest. The skeletal muscles, for example, are\\nusually in a state of slight contraction called muscle\\ntone. Because even slight contraction requires ATP ,\\nthe muscles are also producing heat. This amounts\\nto about 25% of the total body heat at rest and\\nmuch more during exercise, when more ATP is\\nproduced.\\nThe liver is another organ that is continually\\nactive, producing ATP to supply energy for its\\nmany functions. As a result, the liver produces as\\nmuch as 20% of the total body heat at rest. The\\nheat produced by these active organs is dispersed\\nthroughout the body by the blood. As the relatively\\ncooler blood ﬂows through organs such as the mus-\\ncles and liver, the heat they produce is transferred\\nto the blood, warming it. The warmed blood circu-\\nlates to other areas of the body, distributing this\\nheat.\\n4. The intake of food also increases heat production,\\nbecause the metabolic activity of the digestive tract\\nis increased. Heat is generated as the digestive\\n396 Body Temperature and Metabolism\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 396'),\n",

Changes in body temperature also have an effect\\non metabolic rate and heat production. This\\nbecomes clinically important when a person has\\na fever, an abnormally high body tempera-\\nture. The higher temperature increases the meta-\\nbolic rate, which increases heat production and\\nelevates body temperature further. Thus, a high\\nfever may trigger a vicious cycle of ever-increasing\\nheat production. Fever is discussed later in this\\nchapter.\\nThe factors that affect heat production are summa-\\nrized in T able 17–1.\\nHEAT LOSS\\nThe pathways of heat loss from the body are the skin,\\nthe respiratory tract, and, to a lesser extent, the uri-\\nnary and digestive tracts.\\nHeat Loss through the Skin\\nBecause the skin covers the body, most body heat is\\nlost from the skin to the environment. When the envi-\\nronment is cooler than body temperature (as it usually\\nis), heat loss is unavoidable. The amount of heat that\\nis lost is determined by blood ﬂow through the skin\\nand by the activity of sweat glands.\\nBlood ﬂow through the skin inﬂuences the amount\\nof heat lost by the processes of radiation, conduction,\\nand convection. Radiation means that heat from the\\nbody is transferred to cooler objects not touching the\\nskin, much as a radiator warms the contents of a room\\n(radiation starts to become less effective when the\\nenvironmental temperature rises above 88 °F). Con-\\nduction is the loss of heat to cooler air or objects, such\\nas clothing, that touch the skin. Convection means\\nthat air currents move the warmer air away from the\\nskin surface and facilitate the loss of heat; this is why a\\nfan makes us feel cooler on hot days. Loss of heat by\\nconvection also gives us the “wind chill factor” we\\nhear about in winter. A cold day that is windy will feel\\ncolder than a cold day when the air is still, because the\\nwind blows the slightly warmer air surrounding the\\nbody away, replacing it with colder air.\\nAs you may recall from Chapter 5, the tempera-\\nture of the skin and the subsequent loss of heat are\\ndetermined by blood ﬂow through the skin. The arte-\\nrioles in the dermis may constrict or dilate to decrease\\nor increase blood ﬂow. In a cold environment, vaso-\\nconstriction decreases blood ﬂow through the dermis\\nand thereby decreases heat loss. In a warm environ-\\nment, vasodilation in the dermis increases blood ﬂow\\nto the body surface and loss of heat to the environ-\\nment.\\nThe other mechanism by which heat is lost from\\nthe skin is sweating. The eccrine sweat glands\\nsecrete sweat (water) onto the skin surface, and excess\\nbody heat evaporates the sweat. Think of running\\nwater into a hot frying pan; the pan is rapidly cooled\\nas its heat vaporizes the water. Although sweating is\\nnot quite as dramatic (no visible formation of steam),\\nthe principle is just the same.\\nSweating is most efficient when the humidity of the\\nsurrounding air is low. Humidity is the percentage of\\nthe maximum amount of water vapor the atmosphere\\ncan contain. A humidity reading of 90% means that\\nthe air is already 90% saturated with water vapor and\\ncan hold little more.

In air that is com-\\npletely dry, a person may tolerate a temperature of\\n200°F for nearly 1 hour.\\nAlthough sweating is a very effective mechanism of\\nheat loss, it does have a disadvantage in that it requires\\nthe loss of water in order to also lose heat. Water loss\\nduring sweating may rapidly lead to dehydration, and\\nthe water lost must be replaced by drinking ﬂuids (see\\nBox 17–1: Heat-Related Disorders).\\nSmall amounts of heat are also lost in what is called\\n“insensible water loss.” Because the skin is not like a\\nplastic bag, but is somewhat permeable to water, a\\nsmall amount of water diffuses through the skin and is\\nevaporated by body heat. Compared to sweating, how-\\never, insensible water loss is a minor source of heat\\nloss.\\nHeat Loss through\\nthe Respiratory Tract\\nHeat is lost from the respiratory tract as the warmth of\\nthe respiratory mucosa evaporates some water from\\nthe living epithelial surface. The water vapor formed\\nis exhaled, and a small amount of heat is lost.\\nAnimals such as dogs that do not have numerous\\nsweat glands often pant in warm weather.

In this way the animal\\nmay lose large amounts of heat.\\nHeat Loss through the Urinary\\nand Digestive Tracts\\nWhen excreted, urine and feces are at body tempera-\\nture, and their elimination results in a very small\\namount of heat loss.\\nThe pathways of heat loss are summarized in T able\\n17–2.\\nREGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE\\nThe hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation\\nof body temperature and is considered the “thermo-\\nstat” of the body. As the thermostat, the hypothalamus\\nmaintains the “setting” of body temperature by bal-\\nancing heat production and heat loss to keep the body\\nat the set temperature.\\nT o do this, the hypothalamus must receive infor-\\nmation about the temperature within the body and\\nabout the environmental temperature. Specialized\\nneurons of the hypothalamus detect changes in the\\ntemperature of the blood that ﬂows through the brain.\\nThe temperature receptors in the skin provide infor-\\nmation about the external temperature changes to\\nwhich the body is exposed.

As ﬂuid loss increases, sweating stops to\\npreserve body ﬂuid, and body temperature rises\\nrapidly (over 105°F , possibly as high as 110 °F ).\\nThe classic symptom of heat stroke is hot, dry\\nskin. The affected person often loses consciousness,\\nreﬂecting the destructive effect of such a high body\\ntemperature on the brain. Treatment should involve\\nhospitalization so that IV ﬂuids may be adminis-\\ntered and body temperature lowered under med-\\nical supervision. A ﬁrst-aid measure would be the\\napplication of cool (not ice cold) water to as much\\nof the skin as possible. Fluids should never be forced\\non an unconscious person, because the ﬂuid may\\nbe aspirated into the respiratory tract.\\nHeat exhaustion is caused by excessive sweating\\nwith loss of water and salts, especially NaCl.

This is accomplished by vasodilation in the\\ndermis and an increase in sweating. Vasodilation\\nbrings more warm blood close to the body surface,\\nand heat is lost to the environment. However, if the\\nenvironmental temperature is close to or higher than\\nbody temperature, this mechanism becomes ineffec-\\ntive. The second mechanism is increased sweating, in\\nwhich excess body heat evaporates the sweat on the\\nskin surface. As mentioned previously, sweating\\nbecomes inefficient when the atmospheric humidity is\\nhigh.\\nOn hot days, heat production may also be\\ndecreased by a decrease in muscle tone. This is why we\\nmay feel very sluggish on hot days; our muscles are\\neven slightly less contracted than usual and are slower\\nto respond.\\nMechanisms to Conserve Heat\\nIn a cold environment, heat loss from the body is\\nunavoidable but may be reduced to some extent.\\nVasoconstriction in the dermis shunts blood away\\nfrom the body surface, so that more heat is kept in the\\ncore of the body. Sweating decreases, and will stop\\ncompletely if the temperature of the hypothalamus\\nfalls below about 98.6°F . (Remember that the internal\\ntemperature of the brain is higher than an oral tem-\\nperature, and is less subject to any changes in environ-\\nmental temperature.)\\nIf these mechanisms are not sufficient to prevent\\nthe body temperature from dropping, more heat may\\nbe produced by increasing muscle tone. When this\\ngreater muscle tone becomes noticeable and rhythmic,\\nit is called shivering and may increase heat production\\nby as much as ﬁve times the normal.\\nPeople also have behavioral responses to cold, and\\nthese too are important to prevent heat loss. Such\\nthings as putting on a sweater or going indoors reﬂect\\nour awareness of the discomfort of being cold. For\\npeople (we do not have thick fur as do some other\\nmammals), these voluntary activities are of critical\\nimportance to the prevention of excessive heat loss\\nwhen it is very cold (see Box 17–2: Cold-Related\\nDisorders).\\nFEVER\\nA fever is an abnormally high body temperature\\nand may accompany infectious diseases, extensive\\nphysical trauma, cancer, or damage to the CNS. The\\nsubstances that may cause a fever are called pyrogens.\\nPyrogens include bacteria, foreign proteins, and\\nchemicals released during inflammation. These\\ninﬂammatory chemicals are called endogenous pyro-\\ngens. Endogenous means “generated from within.” It\\nis believed that pyrogens chemically affect the hypo-\\nthalamus and “raise the setting” of the hypothalamic\\nthermostat. The hypothalamus will then stimulate\\nresponses by the body to raise body temperature to\\nthis higher setting.\\nLet us use as a speciﬁc example a child who has a\\nstrep throat. The bacterial and endogenous pyrogens\\nreset the hypothalamic thermostat upward, to 102 °F.\\nAt ﬁrst, the body is “colder” than the setting of the\\nhypothalamus, and the heat conservation and produc-\\ntion mechanisms are activated. The child feels cold\\nand begins to shiver (chills). Eventually, sufficient heat\\nis produced to raise the body temperature to the hypo-\\nthalamic setting of 102 °F . At this time, the child will\\nfeel neither too warm nor too cold, because the body\\ntemperature is what the hypothalamus wants.\\nAs the effects of the pyrogens diminish, the hypo-\\nthalamic setting decreases, perhaps close to normal\\nagain, 99°F . Now the child will feel warm, and the heat\\nloss mechanisms will be activated. Vasodilation in the\\nskin and sweating will occur until the body tempera-\\nture drops to the new hypothalamic setting. This\\nis sometimes referred to as the “crisis,” but actually\\nthe crisis has passed, because sweating indicates that\\nBody Temperature and Metabolism 399\\nTable 17–2 PATHWAYS OF HEAT LOSS\\nPathway Mechanism\\nSkin (major\\npathway)\\nRespiratory tract\\n(secondary\\npathway)\\nUrinary tract\\n(minor pathway)\\nDigestive tract\\n(minor pathway)\\n• Radiation and conduction—\\nheat is lost from the body to\\ncooler air or objects.\\n• Convection—air currents move\\nwarm air away from the skin.\\n• Sweating—excess body heat\\nevaporates sweat on the skin\\nsurface.\\n• Evaporation—body heat evap-\\norates water from the respira-\\ntory mucosa, and water vapor\\nis exhaled.\\n• Urination—urine is at body\\ntemperature when eliminated.\\n• Defecation—feces are at body\\ntemperature when eliminated.\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 399'),\n",

The\\nsequence of temperature changes during a fever is\\nshown in Fig. 17–1.\\nY ou may be wondering if a fever serves a useful pur-\\npose. For low fevers that are the result of infection, the\\nanswer is yes. White blood cells increase their activity\\nat moderately elevated temperatures, and the metabo-\\nlism of some pathogens is inhibited. Thus, a fever may\\nbe beneﬁcial in that it may shorten the duration of an\\ninfection by accelerating the destruction of the\\npathogen.\\nHigh fevers, however, may have serious conse-\\nquences. A fever increases the metabolic rate, which\\nincreases heat production, which in turn raises body\\ntemperature even more. This is a positive feedback\\nmechanism that will continue until an external event\\n(such as aspirin or death of the pathogens) acts as a\\nbrake (see Fig. 1–3). When the body temperature rises\\nabove 106°F , the hypothalamus begins to lose its abil-\\nity to regulate temperature. The proteins of cells,\\nespecially the enzymes, are also damaged by such high\\ntemperatures. Enzymes become denatured, that is,\\nlose their shape and do not catalyze the reactions nec-\\nessary within cells (see Fig. 2–9). As a result, cells\\nbegin to die. This is most serious in the brain, because\\nneurons cannot be replaced, and cellular death is the\\ncause of brain damage that may follow a prolonged\\nhigh fever. The effects of changes in body temperature\\non the hypothalamus are shown in Fig. 17–2.\\nA medication such as aspirin is called an anti-\\npyretic because it lowers a fever, probably by affecting\\nthe hypothalamic thermostat. T o help lower a high\\nfever, the body may be cooled by sponging it with cool\\nwater. The excessive body heat will cause this external\\nwater to evaporate, thus reducing temperature. A very\\nhigh fever requires medical attention.\\nMETABOLISM\\nThe term metabolism encompasses all of the reac-\\ntions that take place in the body. Everything that hap-\\npens within us is part of our metabolism. The reactions\\nof metabolism may be divided into two major cate-\\ngories: anabolism and catabolism.\\nAnabolism means synthesis or “formation” reac-\\ntions, the bonding together of smaller molecules to\\nform larger ones. The synthesis of hemoglobin by\\ncells of the red bone marrow, synthesis of glycogen by\\nliver cells, and synthesis of fat to be stored in adipose\\ntissue are all examples of anabolism. Such reactions\\nrequire energy, usually in the form of ATP .\\n400 Body Temperature and Metabolism\\nBOX 17–2 COLD-RELATED DISORDERS\\nslurred speech, drowsiness, and lack of coordina-\\ntion. At this stage, people often do not realize the\\nseriousness of their condition, and if outdoors (ice\\nskating or skiing) may not seek a warmer environ-\\nment. In progressive hypothermia, breathing and\\nheart rate slow, and coma and death follow.\\nOther people at greater risk for hypothermia\\ninclude the elderly, whose temperature-regulating\\nmechanisms are no longer effective, and quadriple-\\ngics, who have no sensation of cold in the body. For\\nboth of these groups, heat production is or may be\\nlow because of inactivity of skeletal muscles.\\nArtiﬁcial hypothermia may be induced during\\nsome types of cardiovascular or neurologic surgery.\\nThis carefully controlled lowering of body tempera-\\nture decreases the metabolic rate and need for\\noxygen and makes possible prolonged surgery\\nwithout causing extensive tissue death in the\\npatient.\\nFrostbite is the freezing of part of the body.\\nFingers, toes, the nose, and ears are most often\\naffected by prolonged exposure to cold, because\\nthese areas have little volume in proportion to their\\nsurface.\\nAt ﬁrst the skin tingles, then becomes numb.

This simple summary is depicted\\nin Fig. 17–3.\\nGlycolysis\\nThe enzymes for the reactions of glycolysis are found\\nin the cytoplasm of cells, and oxygen is not required\\n(glycolysis is an anaerobic process). Refer now to Fig.\\n17–3 as you read the following. In glycolysis, a six-\\ncarbon glucose molecule is broken down to two three-\\ncarbon molecules of pyruvic acid. T wo molecules of\\nATP are necessary to start the process. The energy\\nthey supply is called energy of activation and is neces-\\nsary to make glucose unstable enough to begin to break\\ndown. As a result of these reactions, enough energy is\\nreleased to synthesize four molecules of ATP , for a net\\ngain of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Also\\nduring glycolysis, two pairs of hydrogens are removed\\nby NAD, a carrier molecule that contains the vitamin\\nniacin. T wo NAD molecules thus become 2NADH\\n2,\\nand these attached hydrogen pairs will be transported\\nto the cytochrome transport system (stage 3).\\nIf no oxygen is present in the cell, as may happen in\\nmuscle cells during exercise, pyruvic acid is converted\\nto lactic acid, which causes muscle fatigue. If oxygen is\\npresent, however, pyruvic acid continues into the next\\nstage, the Krebs citric acid cycle (or, more simply, the\\nKrebs cycle).\\nKrebs Citric Acid Cycle\\nThe enzymes for the Krebs cycle (or citric acid\\ncycle) are located in the mitochondria of cells. This\\nsecond stage of cell respiration is aerobic, meaning\\nthat oxygen is required. In a series of reactions, a pyru-\\nvic acid molecule is “taken apart,” and its carbons are\\nconverted to CO\\n2. The ﬁrst CO2 molecule is removed\\nby an enzyme that contains the vitamin thiamine.\\nThis leaves a two-carbon molecule called an acetyl\\ngroup, which combines with a molecule called coen-\\nzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). As\\nacetyl CoA continues in the Krebs cycle, two more\\ncarbons are removed as CO\\n2, and more pairs of hydro-\\ngens are picked up by NAD and FAD (another carrier\\nmolecule that contains the vitamin riboflavin ).\\nNADH\\n2 and FADH2 will carry their hydrogens to the\\ncytochrome transport system.\\nDuring the Krebs cycle, a small amount of energy\\nis released, enough to synthesize one molecule of ATP\\n(two per glucose). Notice also that a four-carbon mol-\\necule (oxaloacetic acid) is regenerated after the forma-\\ntion of CO\\n2. This molecule will react with the next\\nacetyl CoA, which is what makes the Krebs cycle truly\\na self-perpetuating cycle. The results of the stages of\\ncell respiration are listed in T able 17–3. Before you\\ncontinue, you may wish to look at that table to see just\\nwhere the process has gotten thus far.\\nCytochrome Transport System\\nCytochromes are proteins that contain either iron or\\ncopper and are found in the mitochondria of cells.\\nThe pairs of hydrogens that were once part of glucose\\nare brought to the cytochromes by the carrier mole-\\ncules NAD and FAD. Each hydrogen atom is then\\nsplit into its proton (H\\n+ ion) and its electron. The\\nelectrons of the hydrogens are passed from one\\ncytochrome to the next, and ﬁnally to oxygen. The\\nreactions of the electrons with the cytochromes\\nrelease most of the energy that was contained in the\\nglucose molecule, enough to synthesize 34 molecules\\nof ATP . As you can see, most of the ATP produced in\\ncell respiration comes from this third stage.\\nFinally, and very importantly, each oxygen atom\\nthat has gained two electrons (from the cytochromes)\\nreacts with two of the H\\n+ ions (protons) to form water.\\nThe formation of metabolic water contributes to the\\nnecessary intracellular ﬂuid, and also prevents acido-\\nsis. If H\\n+ ions accumulated, they would rapidly lower\\nthe pH of the cell. This does not happen, however,\\nbecause the H\\n+ ions react with oxygen to form water,\\nand a decrease in pH is prevented.\\nThe summary of the three stages of cell respiration\\nin T able 17–3 also includes the vitamins and minerals\\nthat are essential for this process. An important over-\\nall concept is the relationship between eating and\\nbreathing. Eating provides us with a potential energy\\nsource (often glucose) and with necessary vitamins and\\nminerals. However, to release the energy from food,\\nwe must breathe. This is why we breathe. The oxygen\\nwe inhale is essential for the completion of cell respi-\\nration, and the CO\\n2 produced is exhaled.\\nProteins and Fats as Energy Sources\\nAlthough glucose is the preferred energy source for\\ncells, proteins and fats also contain potential energy\\nand are alternative energy sources in certain situations.\\nAs you know, proteins are made of the smaller mol-\\necules called amino acids, and the primary use for the\\namino acids we obtain from food is the synthesis of\\nBody Temperature and Metabolism 403\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 403'),\n",

In the process of beta-\\noxidation, the long carbon chains of fatty acids are split\\ninto two-carbon acetyl groups, which enter a later step\\nin the Krebs cycle (see Fig. 17–3).\\nBoth amino acids and fatty acids may be converted\\nby the liver to ketones, which are two- or four-carbon\\nmolecules such as acetone and acetoacetic acid.\\nAlthough body cells can use ketones in cell respira-\\ntion, they do so slowly. In situations in which fats or\\namino acids have become the primary energy sources,\\na state called ketosis may develop; this is described in\\nBox 17–3: Ketosis. Excess amino acids may also be\\nconverted to glucose; this is important to supply the\\nbrain when dietary intake of carbohydrates is low. The\\neffects of hormones on the metabolism of food are\\nsummarized in T able 17–4.\\nEnergy Available from\\nthe Three Nutrient Types\\nThe potential energy in food is measured in units\\ncalled Calories or kilocalories. A calorie (lowercase\\n“c”) is the amount of energy needed to raise the tem-\\nperature of 1 gram of water 1 °C. A kilocalorie or\\nCalorie (capital “C”) is 1000 times that amount of\\nenergy.\\nOne gram of carbohydrate yields about 4 kilocalo-\\nries. A gram of protein also yields about 4 kilocalories.\\nA gram of fat, however, yields 9 kilocalories, and\\na gram of alcohol yields 7 kilocalories. This is why a\\ndiet high in fat is more likely to result in weight gain\\nif the calories are not expended in energy-requiring\\nactivities.\\nY ou may have noticed that calorie content is part of\\nthe nutritional information on food labels. On such\\nlabels the term calorie actually means Calorie or kilo-\\ncalories but is used for the sake of simplicity.\\nSYNTHESIS USES OF FOODS\\nBesides being available for energy production, each of\\nthe three food types is used in anabolic reactions to\\nBody Temperature and Metabolism 405\\nTable 17–3 SUMMARY OF CELL RESPIRATION\\nMolecules That Vitamins or \\nStage Enter the Process Results Minerals Needed\\nGlycolysis\\n(cytoplasm)\\nKrebs citric acid cycle\\n(mitochondria)\\nCytochrome\\ntransport system\\n(mitochondria)\\n• 2 ATP (net)\\n• 2 NADH 2 (to cytochrome\\ntransport system)\\n• 2 pyruvic acid (aerobic:\\nto Krebs cycle; anaerobic:\\nlactic acid formation)\\n•C O 2 (exhaled)\\n• ATP (2 per glucose)\\n• 3 NADH\\n2 and 1 FADH2 (to\\ncytochrome transport system)\\n• A 4-carbon molecule is regen-\\nerated for the next cycle\\n• 34 ATP\\n• Metabolic water\\n• Niacin (part of NAD)\\n• Thiamine (for removal\\nof CO2)\\n• Niacin (part of NAD)\\n• Riboﬂavin (part of FAD)\\n• Pantothenic acid (part\\nof coenzyme A)\\n• Iron and copper (part\\nof some cytochromes)\\nGlucose—ATP needed as\\nenergy of activation\\nPyruvic acid—from glucose\\nor glycerol or excess\\namino acids\\nor\\nAcetyl CoA—from fatty acids\\nor excess amino acids\\nNADH\\n2 and FADH2—from\\nglycolysis or the Krebs\\ncycle\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 405'),\n",

Ketones are organic molecules such as\\nacetone that may be changed to acetyl CoA and\\nenter the Krebs cycle. Other cells are able to use\\nketones as an energy source, but they do so\\nslowly. When ketones are produced in small\\namounts, as they usually are between meals, the\\nblood level does not rise sharply.\\nA state of ketosis exists when fats and pro-\\nteins become the primary energy sources, and\\nketones accumulate in the blood faster than cells\\ncan utilize them. Because ketones are organic\\nacids, they lower the pH of the blood. As the\\nblood ketone level rises, the kidneys excrete\\nketones, but they must also excrete more water\\nas a solvent, which leads to dehydration.\\nKetosis is clinically important in diabetes mel-\\nlitus, starvation, and eating disorders such as\\nanorexia nervosa. Diabetics whose disease is\\npoorly controlled may progress to ketoacido-\\nsis, a form of metabolic acidosis that may lead to\\nconfusion, coma, and death. Reversal of this\\nstate requires a carbohydrate energy source and\\nthe insulin necessary to utilize it.\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 406'),\n",

Most adipose tis-\\nsue is found subcutaneously and is potential energy for\\ntimes when food intake decreases. Notice in T able\\n17–4 that insulin promotes fat synthesis and storage.\\nOne theory of weight gain proposes that a diet high in\\nsugars and starches stimulates the secretion of so\\nmuch insulin that fat can only be stored, not taken out\\nof storage and used for energy.\\nFatty acids and glycerol are also used for the syn-\\nthesis of phospholipids, which are essential compo-\\nnents of all cell membranes. Myelin, for example, is a\\nphospholipid of the membranes of Schwann cells,\\nwhich form the myelin sheath of peripheral neurons.\\nThe liver can synthesize most of the fatty acids\\nneeded by the body. T wo exceptions are linoleic acid\\nand linolenic acid, which are essential fatty acids and\\nmust be obtained from the diet. Linoleic acid is part of\\nlecithin, which in turn is part of all cell membranes.\\nVegetable oils are good sources of these essential fatty\\nacids.\\nWhen fatty acids are broken down in the process of\\nbeta-oxidation, the resulting acetyl groups may also be\\nused for the synthesis of cholesterol, a steroid. This\\ntakes place primarily in the liver, although all cells are\\ncapable of synthesizing cholesterol for their cell mem-\\nbranes. The liver uses cholesterol to synthesize bile\\nsalts for the emulsiﬁcation of fats in digestion. The\\nsteroid hormones are also synthesized from choles-\\nterol. Cortisol and aldosterone are produced by the\\nadrenal cortex, estrogen and progesterone by the\\novaries, and testosterone by the testes.\\nVITAMINS AND MINERALS\\nVitamins are organic molecules needed in very small\\namounts for normal body functioning. Some vitamins\\nare coenzymes; that is, they are necessary for the\\nfunctioning of certain enzymes. Others are antioxi-\\ndant vitamins, including vitamins C, E, and beta-\\ncarotene (a precursor for vitamin A). Antioxidants\\nprevent damage from free radicals, which are mole-\\ncules that contain an unpaired electron and are highly\\nreactive. The reactions of free radicals can damage\\nDNA, cell membranes, and the cell organelles. Free\\nradicals are formed during some normal body reac-\\ntions, but smoking and exposure to pollution will\\nincrease their formation. Antioxidant vitamins com-\\nbine with free radicals before they can react with cel-\\nlular components. Plant foods are good sources of\\nthese vitamins. T able 17–5 summarizes some impor-\\ntant metabolic and nutritional aspects of the vitamins\\nwe need.\\nDeﬁciencies of vitamins often result in disease:\\nvitamin C deﬁciency and scurvy, for example (see Box\\n4–2). Other deﬁciency diseases that have been known\\nfor decades include pellagra (lack of niacin), beri-beri\\n(riboﬂavin), pernicious anemia (B\\n12), and rickets (D).\\nMore recently the importance of folic acid (folacin)\\nfor the development of the fetal central nervous sys-\\ntem has been recognized. Adequate folic acid during\\npregnancy can signiﬁcantly decrease the chance of\\nspina biﬁda (open spinal column) and anencephaly\\n(absence of the cerebrum, always fatal) in a fetus. All\\nwomen should be aware of the need for extra (400\\nmicrograms) folic acid during pregnancy.\\nMinerals are simple inorganic chemicals and have\\na variety of functions, many of which you are already\\nfamiliar with. T able 17–6 lists some important aspects\\nof minerals. We will return to the minerals as part of\\nour study of ﬂuid–electrolyte balance in Chapter 19.\\nMETABOLIC RATE\\nAlthough the term metabolism is used to describe all\\nof the chemical reactions that take place within the\\nbody, metabolic rate is usually expressed as an\\namount of heat production. This is because many\\nbody processes that utilize ATP also produce heat.\\nThese processes include the contraction of skeletal\\nmuscle, the pumping of the heart, and the normal\\nbreakdown of cellular components. Therefore, it is\\npossible to quantify heat production as a measure of\\nmetabolic activity.\\nAs mentioned previously, the energy available from\\nfood is measured in kilocalories (kcal). Kilocalories are\\nalso the units used to measure the energy expended by\\nthe body. During sleep, for example, energy expended\\nby a 150-pound person is about 60 to 70 kcal per hour.\\nGetting up and preparing breakfast increases energy\\nexpenditure to 80 to 90 kcal per hour. For mothers\\nwith several small children, this value may be signiﬁ-\\ncantly higher. Clearly, greater activity results in\\ngreater energy expenditure.\\nThe energy required for merely living (lying qui-\\netly in bed) is the basal metabolic rate (BMR).

There will also be loss\\nof some body protein so that amino acids can be\\nconverted to carbohydrates to supply the brain.\\nA sensible weight-loss diet will include carbohy-\\ndrate to supply energy needs, will have sufficient\\nprotein (40 to 45 grams per day), and will be low in\\nanimal fat. Including vegetables and fruits will sup-\\nply vitamins, minerals, and ﬁber.\\nAlthough diet books are often found on the best-\\nseller lists, there is no magic method that will result\\nin weight loss.

What was ﬁrst believed to be a simple chem-\\nical signal has proved to be much more complex.\\nA good measure of leanness or fatness is the\\nbody-mass index.\\nTo calculate: Multiple weight in pounds by 703.\\nDivide by height in inches.\\nDivide again by height in inches = body-mass\\nindex\\nExample: A person ﬁve foot six weighing 130\\npounds.\\n130 x 703 = 91,390\\n91,390 /H1100466 = 1385\\n1385 /H1100466 = 20.98\\nThe optimal body-mass index is considered to be\\n21. Any index over 25 is considered overweight.\\nThe 1994 discovery of the hormone leptin was\\nreported to the general public in 1995, along with\\nspeculation that leptin could become an anti-obe-\\nsity medication, which it has not. Leptin is a protein\\nproduced by fat cells, and signals the hypothalamus\\nto release a chemical that acts as an appetite sup-\\npressant. It seems to inform the brain of how much\\nstored fat the body has, and is therefore involved in\\nthe regulation of body weight (along with many\\nother chemicals, some still unknown).\\nAnother likely role for leptin is as a contributor to\\nthe onset of puberty, especially in females. Girls\\nwho are very thin, with little body fat, tend to have\\na later ﬁrst menstrual period than girls with average\\nbody fat, and a certain level of body fat is necessary\\nfor continued ovulation. Leptin may be the chemi-\\ncal mediator of this information.\\nThe most recent research indicates that leptin\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 412'),\n",

T emperature regulation in infants and the elderly is\\nnot as precise as it is at other ages.\\nHeat Production\\nHeat is one of the energy products of cell respiration.\\nMany factors affect the total heat actually produced\\n(see T able 17–1).\\n1. Thyroxine from the thyroid gland—the most im-\\nportant regulator of daily heat production. As meta-\\nbolic rate decreases, more thyroxine is secreted to\\nincrease the rate of cell respiration.\\n2. Stress—sympathetic impulses and epinephrine and\\nnorepinephrine increase the metabolic activity of\\nmany organs, increasing the production of ATP\\nand heat.\\n3. Active organs continuously produce heat. Skeletal\\nmuscle tone produces 25% of the total body heat at\\nrest. The liver provides up to 20% of the resting\\nbody heat.\\n4. Food intake increases the activity of the digestive\\norgans and increases heat production.\\n5. Changes in body temperature affect metabolic rate.\\nA fever increases the metabolic rate, and more heat\\nis produced; this may become detrimental during\\nvery high fevers.\\nHeat Loss (see Table 17–2)\\n1. Most heat is lost through the skin.\\n2. Blood ﬂow through the dermis determines the\\namount of heat that is lost by radiation, conduc-\\ntion, and convection.\\n3. Vasodilation in the dermis increases blood ﬂow and\\nheat loss; radiation and conduction are effective\\nonly if the environment is cooler than the body.\\n4. Vasoconstriction in the dermis decreases blood\\nﬂow and conserves heat in the core of the body.\\n5. Sweating is a very effective heat loss mechanism;\\nexcess body heat evaporates sweat on the skin sur-\\nface; sweating is most effective when the atmos-\\npheric humidity is low.\\n6. Sweating also has a disadvantage in that water is\\nlost and must be replaced to prevent serious dehy-\\ndration.\\n7. Heat is lost from the respiratory tract by the evap-\\noration of water from the warm respiratory\\nmucosa; water vapor is part of exhaled air.\\n8. A very small amount of heat is lost as urine and\\nfeces are excreted at body temperature.\\nBody Temperature and Metabolism 413\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nincreased secretion of thyroxine and a higher meta-\\nbolic rate.\\nAGING AND METABOLISM\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, metabolic rate\\ndecreases with age. Elderly people who remain active,\\nhowever, can easily maintain a metabolic rate (energy\\nproduction) adequate for their needs as long as their\\ngeneral health is good. Some elderly people subject to\\nphysical or emotional disability, however, may be at\\nrisk for malnutrition. Caregivers may assess such a risk\\nby asking how often the person eats every day; if\\nappetite is good, fair, or poor; and how the food tastes.\\nThese simple questions may help ensure adequate\\nnutrition.\\nSensitivity to external temperature changes may\\ndecrease with age, and the regulation of body temper-\\nature is no longer as precise. Sweat glands are not as\\nactive, and prolonged high environmental tempera-\\ntures are a real danger for elderly people. In August\\n2003, in Europe, an unusually long and severe heat\\nwave was the cause of at least 25,000 deaths. Most of\\nthose who died were elderly.\\nSUMMARY\\nFood is needed for the synthesis of new cells and tis-\\nsues, or is utilized to produce the energy required for\\nsuch synthesis reactions. As a consequence of metabo-\\nlism, heat energy is released to provide a constant\\nbody temperature and permit the continuation of\\nmetabolic activity. The metabolic pathways described\\nin this chapter are only a small portion of the body’s\\ntotal metabolism. Even this simple presentation, how-\\never, suggests the great chemical complexity of the\\nfunctioning human being.\\n17Scanlon(p3)-ch17  8/17/06  11:00 AM  Page 413'),\n",

When the pyrogen has been eliminated, the hypo-\\nthalamic setting returns to normal; the person feels\\nwarm, and sweating begins to lose heat to lower the\\nbody temperature.\\n4.

Excess amino acids are deaminated in the liver and\\nconverted to pyruvic acid or acetyl groups to enter\\nthe Krebs cycle.

The upper por-\\ntions of the kidneys rest on the lower surface of the\\ndiaphragm and are enclosed and protected by the\\nlower rib cage (see Fig. 18–1). The kidneys are\\nembedded in adipose tissue that acts as a cushion and\\nis in turn covered by a ﬁbrous connective tissue mem-\\nbrane called the renal fascia , which helps hold the\\nkidneys in place (see Box 18–1: Floating Kidney).\\nEach kidney has an indentation called the hilus\\non its medial side. At the hilus, the renal artery enters\\nthe kidney, and the renal vein and ureter emerge. The\\nrenal artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta, and the\\nrenal vein returns blood to the inferior vena cava (see\\nFig. 18–1). The ureter carries urine from the kidney to\\nthe urinary bladder.\\nINTERNAL STRUCTURE\\nOF THE KIDNEY\\nIn a coronal or frontal section of the kidney, three\\nareas can be distinguished (Fig. 18–2). The lateral and\\nmiddle areas are tissue layers, and the medial area at\\nthe hilus is a cavity. The outer tissue layer is called the\\nrenal cortex; it is made of renal corpuscles and convo-\\nluted tubules. These are parts of the nephron and are\\ndescribed in the next section. The inner tissue layer is\\nthe renal medulla, which is made of loops of Henle\\nand collecting tubules (also parts of the nephron). The\\nrenal medulla consists of wedge-shaped pieces called\\nrenal pyramids. The tip of each pyramid is its apex or\\npapilla.\\nThe third area is the renal pelvis; this is not a layer\\nof tissues, but rather a cavity formed by the expansion\\nof the ureter within the kidney at the hilus. Funnel-\\nshaped extensions of the renal pelvis, called calyces\\n(singular: calyx), enclose the papillae of the renal pyr-\\namids. Urine ﬂows from the renal pyramids into the\\ncalyces, then to the renal pelvis and out into the ureter.\\nTHE NEPHRON\\nThe nephron is the structural and functional unit of\\nthe kidney. Each kidney contains approximately 1 mil-\\nlion nephrons. It is in the nephrons, with their associ-\\nated blood vessels, that urine is formed. Each nephron\\nhas two major portions: a renal corpuscle and a renal\\ntubule. Each of these major parts has further subdivi-\\nsions, which are shown with their blood vessels in Fig.\\n18–3.\\nRenal Corpuscle\\nA renal corpuscle consists of a glomerulus surroun-\\nded by a Bowman’s capsule. The glomerulus is a cap-\\nillary network that arises from an afferent arteriole\\nand empties into an efferent arteriole.

This may happen in very thin\\npeople whose renal cushion of adipose tissue is\\nthin, or it may be the result of a sharp blow to\\nthe back that dislodges a kidney.\\nA kidney can function in any position; the\\nproblem with a ﬂoating kidney is that the ureter\\nmay become twisted or kinked. If urine cannot\\nﬂow through the ureter, the urine backs up and\\ncollects in the renal pelvis. Incoming urine\\nfrom the renal tubules then backs up as well.

The inner layer of Bowman’s capsule is\\nmade of podocytes; the name means “foot cells,” and\\nthe “feet” of the podocytes are on the surface of the\\nglomerular capillaries. The arrangement of podocytes\\ncreates pores, spaces between adjacent “feet,” which\\nmake this layer very permeable. The outer layer of\\nBowman’s capsule has no pores and is not permeable.\\nThe space between the inner and outer layers of\\nBowman’s capsule contains renal ﬁltrate, the ﬂuid that\\nis formed from the blood in the glomerulus and will\\neventually become urine.\\nRenal Tubule\\nThe renal tubule continues from Bowman’s capsule\\nand consists of the following parts: proximal convo-\\nluted tubule (in the renal cortex), loop of Henle (or\\nloop of the nephron, in the renal medulla), and distal\\nconvoluted tubule (in the renal cortex). The distal\\nconvoluted tubules from several nephrons empty into\\na collecting tubule . Several collecting tubules then\\nunite to form a papillary duct that empties urine into\\na calyx of the renal pelvis.\\nCross-sections of the parts of the renal tubule are\\nshown in Fig. 18–3. Notice how thin the walls of the\\ntubule are, and also the microvilli in the proximal con-\\nvoluted tubule. These anatomic characteristics provide\\nfor efficient exchanges of materials, as you will see.\\nAll parts of the renal tubule are surrounded by\\nperitubular capillaries, which arise from the efferent\\narteriole. The peritubular capillaries will receive the\\nmaterials reabsorbed by the renal tubules; this is\\ndescribed in the section on urine formation.\\nBLOOD VESSELS OF THE KIDNEY\\nThe pathway of blood ﬂow through the kidney is an\\nessential part of the process of urine formation. Blood\\nfrom the abdominal aorta enters the renal artery ,\\nwhich branches extensively within the kidney into\\nsmaller arteries (see Fig. 18–2). The smallest arteries\\ngive rise to afferent arterioles in the renal cortex (see\\nFig. 18–3). From the afferent arterioles, blood ﬂows\\ninto the glomeruli (capillaries), to efferent arterioles,\\nto peritubular capillaries, to veins within the kidney, to\\nthe renal vein, and ﬁnally to the inferior vena cava.\\nNotice that in this pathway there are two sets of cap-\\nillaries, and recall that it is in capillaries that exchanges\\ntake place between the blood and surrounding tissues.\\nTherefore, in the kidneys there are two sites of ex-\\nchange. The exchanges that take place between the\\nnephrons and the capillaries of the kidneys will form\\nurine from blood plasma.\\nFigure 18–2 shows two views of a vascular cast of a\\nkidney; the shape of the blood vessels has been pre-\\nserved in red plastic. Y ou can see how dense the vas-\\nculature of a kidney is, and most of these vessels are\\ncapillaries.\\nFORMATION OF URINE\\nThe formation of urine involves three major pro-\\ncesses. The ﬁrst is glomerular ﬁltration, which takes\\nplace in the renal corpuscles. The second and third are\\ntubular reabsorption and tubular secretion, which take\\nplace in the renal tubules.\\nGLOMERULAR FILTRATION\\nY ou may recall that ﬁltration is the process in which\\nblood pressure forces plasma and dissolved material\\nout of capillaries. In glomerular ﬁltration , blood\\npressure forces plasma, dissolved substances, and small\\nproteins out of the glomeruli and into Bowman’s cap-\\nsules. This ﬂuid is no longer plasma but is called renal\\nﬁltrate.\\nThe blood pressure in the glomeruli, compared\\nwith that in other capillaries, is relatively high, about\\n60 mmHg. The pressure in Bowman’s capsule is very\\nlow, and its inner, podocyte layer is very permeable, so\\nthat approximately 20% to 25% of the blood that\\nenters glomeruli becomes renal ﬁltrate in Bowman’s\\ncapsules. The blood cells and larger proteins are too\\nlarge to be forced out of the glomeruli, so they remain\\nin the blood. Waste products are dissolved in blood\\nplasma, so they pass into the renal ﬁltrate. Useful\\nmaterials such as nutrients and minerals are also dis-\\nsolved in plasma and are also present in renal ﬁltrate.\\nFiltration is not selective with respect to usefulness; it\\nis selective only with respect to size. Therefore, renal\\nﬁltrate is very much like blood plasma, except that\\nthere is far less protein and no blood cells are present.\\nThe glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) is the\\namount of renal ﬁltrate formed by the kidneys in 1\\nminute, and averages 100 to 125 mL per minute.

If blood ﬂow increases, the GFR\\nincreases, and more ﬁltrate is formed. If blood ﬂow\\ndecreases (as may happen following a severe hemor-\\nrhage), the GFR decreases, less ﬁltrate is formed, and\\nurinary output decreases (see Box 18–2: Renal Failure\\nand Hemodialysis).\\nTUBULAR REABSORPTION\\nTubular reabsorption takes place from the renal\\ntubules into the peritubular capillaries. In a 24-hour\\nperiod, the kidneys form 150 to 180 liters of ﬁltrate,\\nand normal urinary output in that time is 1 to 2 liters.\\nTherefore, it becomes apparent that most of the renal\\nﬁltrate does not become urine. Approximately 99% of\\nthe ﬁltrate is reabsorbed back into the blood in the\\nperitubular capillaries. Only about 1% of the ﬁltrate\\nwill enter the renal pelvis as urine.\\nMost reabsorption and secretion (about 65%) take\\nplace in the proximal convoluted tubules, whose cells\\nhave microvilli that greatly increase their surface area.\\nThe distal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules\\nare also important sites for the reabsorption of water\\n(Fig. 18–4).\\nMechanisms of Reabsorption\\n1. Active transport—the cells of the renal tubule use\\nATP to transport most of the useful materials from\\nthe ﬁltrate to the blood. These useful materials\\ninclude glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and positive\\nions.\\nFor many of these substances, the renal tubules\\nhave a threshold level of reabsorption. This means\\nthat there is a limit to how much the tubules can\\nremove from the ﬁltrate. For example, if the ﬁltrate\\nlevel of glucose is normal (reﬂecting a normal\\nThe Urinary System 425\\nBOX 18–2 RENAL FAILURE AND HEMODIALYSIS\\nartiﬁcial kidney machine to do what the patient’s\\nnephrons can no longer do.

The increasing success\\nrate of kidney transplants, however, does indeed\\nprovide the possibility of a normal life for people\\nwith chronic renal failure.\\nRenal failure, the inability of the kidneys to func-\\ntion properly, may be the result of three general\\ncauses, which may be called prerenal, intrinsic\\nrenal, and postrenal.\\n“Prerenal” means that the problem is “before”\\nthe kidneys, that is, in the blood ﬂow to the kid-\\nneys. Any condition that decreases blood ﬂow to\\nthe kidneys may result in renal damage and failure.\\nExamples are severe hemorrhage or very low blood\\npressure following a heart attack (MI).\\n“Intrinsic renal” means that the problem is in the\\nkidneys themselves. Diabetes and hypertension\\ndamage the blood vessels of the kidneys, and are\\nthe causes of 70% of all cases of end-stage renal\\nfailure. Bacterial infections of the kidneys or expo-\\nsure to chemicals (certain antibiotics) may cause\\ndamage to the nephrons. Polycystic kidney disease\\nis a genetic disorder in which the kidney tubules\\ndilate and become nonfunctional. Severe damage\\nmay not be apparent until age 40 to 60 years but\\nmay then progress to renal failure.\\n“Postrenal” means that the problem is “after” the\\nkidneys, somewhere in the rest of the urinary tract.\\nObstruction of urine ﬂow may be caused by kidney\\nstones, a twisted ureter, or prostatic hypertrophy.\\nTreatment of renal failure involves correcting the\\nspeciﬁc cause, if possible.

If,\\nhowever, the blood glucose level is above normal,\\nthe amount of glucose in the ﬁltrate will also be\\nabove normal and will exceed the threshold level of\\nreabsorption. The number of glucose molecules to\\nbe reabsorbed is more than the number of the\\ntransporter molecules available to do so. In this sit-\\nuation, therefore, some glucose will remain in the\\nﬁltrate and be present in urine.\\nThe reabsorption of Ca\\n/H110012 ions is increased by\\nparathyroid hormone (PTH). The parathyroid\\nglands secrete PTH when the blood calcium level\\ndecreases. The reabsorption of Ca\\n/H110012 ions by the\\nkidneys is one of the mechanisms by which the\\nblood calcium level is raised back to normal.\\nThe hormone aldosterone, secreted by the adre-\\nnal cortex, increases the reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions\\nand the excretion of K/H11001ions. Besides regulating the\\nblood levels of sodium and potassium, aldosterone\\nalso affects the volume of blood.\\n2. Passive transport—many of the negative ions that\\nare returned to the blood are reabsorbed following\\nthe reabsorption of positive ions, because unlike\\ncharges attract.\\n3. Osmosis—the reabsorption of water follows the\\nreabsorption of minerals, especially sodium ions.\\nThe hormones that affect reabsorption of water are\\ndiscussed in the next section.\\n4. Pinocytosis—small proteins are too large to be\\nreabsorbed by active transport. They become\\nadsorbed to the membranes of the cells of the prox-\\nimal convoluted tubules. The cell membrane then\\nsinks inward and folds around the protein to take it\\nin (see Fig. 3–3 for depictions of this and the other\\ntransport mechanisms). Normally all proteins in\\nthe ﬁltrate are reabsorbed; none is found in urine.\\nTUBULAR SECRETION\\nThis mechanism also changes the composition of\\nurine. In tubular secretion , substances are actively\\nsecreted from the blood in the peritubular capillaries\\ninto the ﬁltrate in the renal tubules. Waste products,\\nsuch as ammonia and some creatinine, and the meta-\\nbolic products of medications may be secreted into the\\nﬁltrate to be eliminated in urine. Hydrogen ions (H\\n/H11001)\\nmay be secreted by the tubule cells to help maintain\\nthe normal pH of blood.\\nHORMONES THAT INFLUENCE\\nREABSORPTION OF WATER\\nAldosterone is secreted by the adrenal cortex in re-\\nsponse to a high blood potassium level, to a low blood\\nsodium level, or to a decrease in blood pressure. When\\naldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions,\\nwater follows from the ﬁltrate back to the blood. This\\nhelps maintain normal blood volume and blood pres-\\nsure.\\nY ou may recall that the antagonist to aldosterone is\\natrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is secreted\\nby the atria of the heart when the atrial walls are\\nstretched by high blood pressure or greater blood vol-\\nume. ANP decreases the reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions by\\nthe kidneys; these remain in the ﬁltrate, as does water,\\nand are excreted. By increasing the elimination of\\nsodium and water, ANP lowers blood volume and\\nblood pressure.\\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the\\nposterior pituitary gland when the amount of water in\\nthe body decreases. Under the inﬂuence of ADH, the\\ndistal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules are\\nable to reabsorb more water from the renal ﬁltrate.\\nThis helps maintain normal blood volume and blood\\npressure, and also permits the kidneys to produce\\nurine that is more concentrated than body ﬂuids.\\nProducing a concentrated urine is essential to prevent\\nexcessive water loss while still excreting all the sub-\\nstances that must be eliminated.\\nIf the amount of water in the body increases, how-\\never, the secretion of ADH diminishes, and the kid-\\nneys will reabsorb less water. Urine then becomes\\ndilute, and water is eliminated until its concentration\\nin the body returns to normal. This may occur follow-\\ning ingestion of excessive quantities of ﬂuids.\\nSUMMARY OF URINE FORMATION\\n1. The kidneys form urine from blood plasma.

Positive ions are\\nreabsorbed by active transport and negative\\nions are reabsorbed most often by passive trans-\\nport.

Hormones such as aldosterone, ANP , and ADH\\ninﬂuence the reabsorption of water and help main-\\ntain normal blood volume and blood pressure. The\\nsecretion of ADH determines whether a concen-\\ntrated or dilute urine will be formed.\\n6. Waste products remain in the renal ﬁltrate and are\\nexcreted in urine. The effects of hormones on the\\nkidneys are summarized in T able 18–1 and illus-\\ntrated in Fig. 18–5.\\nTHE KIDNEYS AND\\nACID–BASE BALANCE\\nThe kidneys are the organs most responsible for main-\\ntaining the pH of blood and tissue ﬂuid within normal\\nranges. They have the greatest ability to compensate\\nfor the pH changes that are a normal part of body\\nmetabolism or the result of disease, and to make the\\nnecessary corrections.\\nThis regulatory function of the kidneys is complex,\\nbut at its simplest it may be described as follows. If\\nbody ﬂuids are becoming too acidic, the kidneys will\\nsecrete more H\\n/H11001ions into the renal ﬁltrate and will\\nreturn more HCO3\\n/H11002ions to the blood. This will help\\nraise the pH of the blood back to normal. The reac-\\ntions involved in such a mechanism are shown in Fig.\\n18–6, to which we will return later. First, however, let\\nus brieﬂy consider how the kidneys will compensate\\nfor body ﬂuids that are becoming too alkaline. Y ou\\nmight expect the kidneys to do just the opposite of\\nwhat was just described, and that is just what happens.\\nThe kidneys will return H\\n/H11001ions to the blood and\\nexcrete HCO3\\n/H11002ions in urine. This will help lower the\\npH of the blood back to normal.\\nBecause the natural tendency is for body ﬂuids to\\nbecome more acidic, let us look at the pH-raising\\nmechanism in more detail (see Fig. 18–6). The cells\\nof the renal tubules can secrete H\\n/H11001ions or ammonia\\nin exchange for Na /H11001ions and, by doing so, inﬂuence\\nthe reabsorption of other ions. Hydrogen ions are\\nobtained from the reaction of CO\\n2 and water (or other\\nprocesses). An amine group from an amino acid is\\ncombined with an H\\n/H11001ion to form ammonia.\\nThe tubule cell secretes the H/H11001ion and the ammo-\\nnia into the renal ﬁltrate, and two Na /H11001ions are reab-\\nsorbed in exchange. In the ﬁltrate, the H /H11001ion and\\nammonia form NH 4\\n/H11001(an ammonium radical), which\\nreacts with a chloride ion (Cl /H11002) to form NH 4Cl\\n(ammonium chloride) that is excreted in urine.\\nAs the Na /H11001ions are returned to the blood in the\\n428 The Urinary System\\nTable 18–1 EFFECTS OF HORMONES ON THE KIDNEYS\\nHormone (gland) Function\\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH)\\n(posterior pituitary)\\nParathyroid hormone (PTH)\\n(parathyroid glands)\\nAldosterone\\n(adrenal cortex)\\nAtrial natriuretic peptide\\n(ANP) (atria of heart)\\n• Increases reabsorption of water from the ﬁltrate to the blood.\\n• Increases reabsorption of Ca /H110012 ions from ﬁltrate to the blood and excretion of\\nphosphate ions into the ﬁltrate.\\n• Increases reabsorption of Na /H11001ions from the ﬁltrate to the blood and excretion of\\nK/H11001ions into the ﬁltrate.

Like the kidneys, the ureters are retroperi-\\ntoneal, that is, behind the peritoneum of the dorsal\\nabdominal cavity.\\nThe smooth muscle in the wall of the ureter con-\\ntracts in peristaltic waves to propel urine toward the\\nurinary bladder. As the bladder ﬁlls, it expands and\\ncompresses the lower ends of the ureters to prevent\\nbackﬂow of urine.\\nURINARY BLADDER\\nThe urinary bladder is a muscular sac below the peri-\\ntoneum and behind the pubic bones. In women, the\\nbladder is inferior to the uterus; in men, the bladder is\\nsuperior to the prostate gland. The bladder is a reser-\\nvoir for accumulating urine, and it contracts to elimi-\\nnate urine.\\nThe mucosa of the bladder is transitional epithe-\\nlium, which permits expansion without tearing the\\nlining. When the bladder is empty, the mucosa\\nappears wrinkled; these folds are rugae, which also\\npermit expansion. On the ﬂoor of the bladder is a tri-\\nangular area called the trigone, which has no rugae\\nand does not expand. The points of the triangle are\\nthe openings of the two ureters and that of the urethra\\n(Fig. 18–7).\\nThe smooth muscle layer in the wall of the bladder\\nis called the detrusor muscle . It is a muscle in the\\nform of a sphere; when it contracts it becomes a\\nsmaller sphere, and its volume diminishes. Around the\\nopening of the urethra the muscle ﬁbers of the detru-\\nsor form the internal urethral sphincter (or sphinc-\\nter of the bladder), which is involuntary.\\nURETHRA\\nThe urethra (see Fig. 18–7) carries urine from the\\nbladder to the exterior. The external urethral\\nsphincter is made of the surrounding skeletal muscle\\nof the pelvic ﬂoor, and is under voluntary control.\\nIn women, the urethra is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 4\\ncm) long and is anterior to the vagina. In men, the\\nurethra is 7 to 8 inches (17 to 20 cm) long. The ﬁrst\\npart just outside the bladder is called the prostatic ure-\\nthra because it is surrounded by the prostate gland.\\nThe next inch is the membranous urethra, around\\nwhich is the external urethral sphincter. The longest\\nportion is the cavernous urethra (or spongy or penile\\nurethra), which passes through the cavernous (or erec-\\ntile) tissue of the penis. The male urethra carries\\nsemen as well as urine.\\nTHE URINATION REFLEX\\nUrination may also be called micturition or voiding.\\nThis reﬂex is a spinal cord reﬂex over which voluntary\\ncontrol may be exerted. The stimulus for the reﬂex is\\nstretching of the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The\\nbladder can hold as much as 800 mL of urine, or even\\nmore, but the reﬂex is activated long before the maxi-\\nmum is reached.\\nWhen urine volume reaches 200 to 400 mL, the\\nstretching is sufficient to generate sensory impulses\\nthat travel to the sacral spinal cord. Motor impulses\\nreturn along parasympathetic nerves to the detrusor\\nmuscle, causing contraction. At the same time, the\\ninternal urethral sphincter relaxes. If the external ure-\\nthral sphincter is voluntarily relaxed, urine ﬂows into\\nthe urethra, and the bladder is emptied.\\nUrination can be prevented by voluntary contrac-\\ntion of the external urethral sphincter. However, if the\\nbladder continues to ﬁll and be stretched, voluntary\\ncontrol is eventually no longer possible.\\nThe Urinary System 431\\nBOX 18–3 ERYTHROPOIETIN\\nAnemia is one of the most debilitating conse-\\nquences of renal failure, one that hemodialysis\\ncannot reverse. Diseased kidneys stop produc-\\ning erythropoietin, a natural stimulus for RBC\\nproduction. Erythropoietin can be produced by\\ngenetic engineering and is available for hemo-\\ndialysis patients. In the past, their anemia could\\nonly be treated with transfusions, which exposed\\nthese patients to possible immunologic compli-\\ncations of repeated exposure to donated blood\\nor to viral diseases. The synthetic erythropoietin\\neliminates such risks. Others who beneﬁt from\\nthis medication are cancer patients and AIDS\\npatients with severe anemia.\\n18Scanlon(p3)-ch18  8/17/06  11:01 AM  Page 431'),\n",

Urea is formed by\\nliver cells when excess amino acids are deaminated\\nto be used for energy production. Creatinine comes\\nfrom the metabolism of creatine phosphate, an\\nenergy source in muscles. Uric acid comes from the\\nmetabolism of nucleic acids, that is, the breakdown\\nof DNA and RNA. Although these are waste prod-\\nucts, there is always a certain amount of each in the\\nblood.

Nephritis (or pyelo-\\nnephritis) is inﬂammation of the kidneys. Although\\nthis may be the result of a systemic bacterial in-\\nfection, nephritis is a common complication of\\nuntreated lower urinary tract infections such as cys-\\ntitis. Possible symptoms are fever and ﬂank pain (in\\nthe area of the kidneys). Untreated nephritis may\\nresult in severe damage to nephrons and progress\\nto renal failure.\\nInfections may occur anywhere in the urinary tract\\nand are most often caused by the microbial agents\\nof sexually transmitted diseases (see Chapter 20) or\\nby the bacteria that are part of the normal ﬂora of\\nthe colon. In women especially, the urinary and\\nanal openings are in close proximity, and colon bac-\\nteria on the skin of the perineum may invade the\\nurinary tract. The use of urinary catheters in hospi-\\ntalized or bedridden patients may also be a factor if\\nsterile technique is not carefully followed.\\nCystitis is inﬂammation of the urinary bladder.\\nSTUDY OUTLINE\\nThe urinary system consists of two kidneys,\\ntwo ureters, the urinary bladder, and the\\nurethra.\\n1.

Collecting tubules unite to\\nform papillary ducts that empty urine into the\\ncalyces of the renal pelvis.\\n• Peritubular capillaries—arise from the efferent\\narteriole and surround all parts of the renal\\ntubule.\\nBlood Vessels of the Kidney (see Figs. 18–1,\\n18–2, and 18–3)\\n1.

Glomerular filtration—takes place from the\\nglomerulus to Bowman’s capsule. High blood pres-\\nsure (60 mmHg) in the glomerulus forces plasma,\\ndissolved materials, and small proteins out of the\\nblood and into Bowman’s capsule. The ﬂuid is now\\ncalled ﬁltrate. Filtration is selective only in terms of\\nsize; blood cells and large proteins remain in the\\nblood.\\n2. GFR is 100 to 125 mL per minute. Increased blood\\nﬂow to the kidney increases GFR; decreased blood\\nﬂow decreases GFR.\\n3. T ubular reabsorption—takes place from the ﬁltrate\\nin the renal tubule to the blood in the peritubular\\ncapillaries; 99% of the ﬁltrate is reabsorbed; only\\n1% becomes urine.\\n• Active transport—reabsorption of glucose,\\namino acids, vitamins, and positive ions; thresh-\\nold level is a limit to the quantity that can be\\nreabsorbed.\\n• Passive transport—most negative ions follow the\\nreabsorption of positive ions.\\n• Osmosis—water follows the reabsorption of\\nminerals, especially sodium.\\n• Pinocytosis—small proteins are engulfed by\\nproximal tubule cells.\\n4. T ubular secretion—takes place from the blood in\\nthe peritubular capillaries to the ﬁltrate in the renal\\ntubule; creatinine and other waste products may be\\nsecreted into the ﬁltrate to be excreted in urine;\\nsecretion of H\\n/H11001ions helps maintain pH of blood.\\n5. Hormones that affect reabsorption—aldosterone,\\natrial natriuretic peptide, antidiuretic hormone,\\nand parathyroid hormone—see T able 18–1 and\\nFig. 18–5.\\nThe Kidneys and Acid–Base Balance\\n1. The kidneys have the greatest capacity to compen-\\nsate for normal and abnormal pH changes.\\n2. If the body ﬂuids are becoming too acidic, the kid-\\nneys excrete H\\n/H11001ions and return HCO 3\\n/H11002ions to\\nthe blood (see Fig. 18–6).\\n3.

In this chapter we will ﬁrst discuss\\nﬂuid–electrolyte balance, then review and summarize\\nthe mechanisms involved in acid–base balance.\\nWATER COMPARTMENTS\\nMost of the water of the body, about two-thirds of the\\ntotal water volume, is found within individual cells and\\nis called intracellular ﬂuid (ICF). The remaining\\nthird is called extracellular ﬂuid (ECF) and includes\\nblood plasma, lymph, tissue ﬂuid, and the specialized\\nﬂuids such as cerebrospinal ﬂuid, synovial ﬂuid, aque-\\nous humor, and serous ﬂuid.\\nWater constantly moves from one ﬂuid site in the\\nbody to another by the processes of ﬁltration and\\nosmosis. These ﬂuid sites are called water compart-\\nments (Fig. 19–1). The chambers of the heart and all\\nof the blood vessels form one compartment, and the\\nwater within is called plasma. By the process of ﬁltra-\\ntion in capillaries, some plasma is forced out into tis-\\nsue spaces (another compartment) and is then called\\ntissue ﬂuid. When tissue ﬂuid enters cells by the\\nprocess of osmosis, it has moved to still another com-\\npartment and is called intracellular ﬂuid. The tissue\\nﬂuid that enters lymph capillaries is in yet another\\ncompartment and is called lymph.\\nThe other process (besides ﬁltration) by which\\nwater moves from one compartment to another is\\nosmosis, which, you may recall, is the diffusion of\\nwater through a semi-permeable membrane. Water\\nwill move through cell membranes from the area of its\\ngreater concentration to the area of its lesser concen-\\ntration. Another way of expressing this is to say that\\nwater will diffuse to an area with a greater concentra-\\ntion of dissolved material. The concentration of elec-\\ntrolytes present in the various water compartments\\ndetermines just how osmosis will take place.

Although water\\nand ions are constantly moving, their relative propor-\\ntions in the compartments remain constant; this is\\nﬂuid–electrolyte homeostasis, and its maintenance is\\nessential for life (see Box 19–1: Edema).\\nWATER INTAKE AND OUTPUT\\nMost of the water the body requires comes from the\\ningestion of liquids; this amount averages 1600 mL\\nper day. The food we eat also contains water. Even\\nfoods we think of as somewhat dry, such as bread,\\ncontain signiﬁcant amounts of water. The daily water\\ntotal from food averages 700 mL. The last source of\\nwater, about 200 mL per day, is the metabolic water\\nthat is a product of cell respiration. The total intake\\nof water per day, therefore, is about 2500 mL, or 2.5\\nliters.\\nMost of the water lost from the body is in the form\\nof urine produced by the kidneys; this averages 1500\\nmL per day. About 500 mL per day is lost in the form\\nof sweat, another 300 mL per day is in the form of\\nwater vapor in exhaled air, and another 200 mL per\\nday is lost in feces. The total output of water is thus\\nabout 2500 mL per day.\\nNaturally, any increase in water output must be\\ncompensated for by an increase in intake. Someone\\nwho exercises strenuously, for example, may lose 1 to\\n2 liters of water in sweat and must replace that water\\nby drinking more ﬂuids. In a healthy individual, water\\nintake equals water output, even though the amounts\\nof each may vary greatly from the averages just men-\\ntioned (Fig. 19–2 and T able 19–1).\\nREGULATION OF WATER\\nINTAKE AND OUTPUT\\nThe hypothalamus in the brain contains osmorecep-\\ntors that detect changes in the osmolarity of body\\nFluid–Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance 443\\nBOX 19–1 EDEMA\\nlower extremities (pulmonary edema was described\\nin Chapter 15).\\nSystemic bacterial infections may increase capil-\\nlary permeability, and loss of plasma to tissue spaces\\nis one aspect of septicemia. In this situation, how-\\never, the edema is of secondary importance to the\\nhypotension, which may be life-threatening.\\nInsufficient osmosis, the return of tissue ﬂuid into\\ncapillaries, is a consequence of a decrease in plasma\\nproteins, especially albumin. This may occur in\\nsevere liver diseases such as cirrhosis, kidney disease\\ninvolving loss of protein in urine, malnutrition, or\\nsevere burn injuries.\\nBecause edema is a symptom rather than a dis-\\nease, treatment is aimed at correcting the speciﬁc\\ncause. If that is not possible, the volume of tissue\\nﬂuid may be diminished by a low-salt diet and the\\nuse of diuretics.\\nEdema is an abnormal increase in the amount of\\ntissue ﬂuid, which may be localized or systemic.\\nSometimes edema is inapparent, and sometimes it\\nis apparent as swelling.\\nLocalized edema follows injury and inﬂamma-\\ntion of a body part. Spraining an ankle, for\\nexample, damages tissues that then release\\nhistamine. Histamine increases the permeability of\\ncapillaries, and more tissue ﬂuid is formed. As\\ntissue ﬂuid accumulates, the ankle may become\\nswollen.\\nSystemic edema is the result of an imbalance\\nbetween the movement of water out of and into\\ncapillaries, that is, between ﬁltration and osmosis.\\nExcessive ﬁltration will occur when capillary pres-\\nsure rises. This may be caused by venous obstruc-\\ntion due to blood clots or by congestive heart\\nfailure.

Osmolarity is the concentration of dissolved\\nmaterials present in a ﬂuid. Dehydration raises the\\nosmolarity of the blood; that is, there is less water in\\nproportion to the amount of dissolved materials.\\nAnother way to express this is to simply say that the\\nblood is now a more concentrated solution. When\\ndehydrated, we feel the sensation of thirst, character-\\nized by dryness of the mouth and throat, as less saliva\\nis produced. Thirst is an uncomfortable sensation, and\\nwe drink ﬂuids to relieve it. The water we drink is\\nreadily absorbed by the mucosa of the stomach and\\nsmall intestine and has the effect of decreasing the\\nosmolarity of the blood.

Aldosterone is secreted\\nwhen the Na /H11001ion concentration of the blood de-\\ncreases or whenever there is a signiﬁcant decrease in\\nblood pressure (the renin-angiotensin mechanism).\\nSeveral other factors may also contribute to water\\nloss. These include excessive sweating, hemorrhage,\\ndiarrhea or vomiting, severe burns, and fever. In these\\ncircumstances, the kidneys will conserve water, but\\nwater must also be replaced by increased consump-\\ntion. Following hemorrhage or during certain disease\\nstates, ﬂuids may also be replaced by intravenous\\nadministration.\\nA less common occurrence is that of too much\\nwater in the body. This may happen following over-\\nconsumption of ﬂuids. The osmolarity of the blood\\ndecreases, and there is too much water in proportion\\nto electrolytes (or, the blood is too dilute). This con-\\ndition may become symptomatic, and is called water\\nintoxication. Symptoms are dizziness, abdominal\\ncramps, nausea, and lethargy. Convulsions are possible\\nin severe cases, and ﬂuids must be restricted until the\\nkidneys can excrete the excess water. A hormone that\\nwill contribute to that is atrial natriuretic peptide\\n(ANP), which is secreted by the atria when blood vol-\\nume or blood pressure increases. ANP then decreases\\nthe reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions by the kidneys, which\\nincreases urinary output of sodium and water. Also,\\nsecretion of ADH will diminish, which will contribute\\nto a greater urinary output that will return the blood\\nosmolarity to normal.\\nELECTROLYTES\\nElectrolytes are chemicals that dissolve in water and\\ndissociate into their positive and negative ions. Most\\nelectrolytes are the inorganic salts, acids, and bases\\nfound in all body ﬂuids.\\nMost organic compounds are non-electrolytes; that\\nis, they do not ionize when in solution. Glucose, for\\nexample, dissolves in water but does not ionize; it\\nremains as intact glucose molecules. Some proteins,\\nhowever, do form ionic bonds and when in solution\\ndissociate into ions.\\nPositive ions are called cations. Examples are Na\\n/H11001,\\nK/H11001, Ca /H110012, Mg /H110012, Fe /H110012, and H /H11001. Negative ions are\\ncalled anions, and examples are Cl /H11002, HCO3\\n/H11002, SO4\\n/H110022\\n(sulfate), HPO4\\n/H110022 (phosphate), and protein anions.\\nElectrolytes help create the osmolarity of body ﬂu-\\nids and, therefore, help regulate the osmosis of water\\nbetween water compartments. Some electrolytes are\\ninvolved in acid–base regulatory mechanisms, or they\\nare part of structural components of tissues or part of\\nenzymes.\\nELECTROLYTES IN BODY FLUIDS\\nThe three principal ﬂuids in the body are intracellular\\nﬂuid and the extracellular ﬂuids plasma and tissue\\nﬂuid. The relative concentrations of the most impor-\\ntant electrolytes in these ﬂuids are depicted in Fig.\\n19–3. The major differences may be summarized as\\nfollows. In intracellular ﬂuid, the most abundant\\ncation is K\\n/H11001, the most abundant anion is HPO4\\n/H110022, and\\nprotein anions are also abundant. In both tissue ﬂuid\\nand plasma, the most abundant cation is Na\\n/H11001, and the\\nmost abundant anion is Cl /H11002. Protein anions form a\\nsigniﬁcant part of plasma but not of tissue ﬂuid. The\\nfunctions of the major electrolytes are described in\\nT able 19–2.\\nINTAKE, OUTPUT, AND REGULATION\\nElectrolytes are part of the food and beverages we\\nconsume, are absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract\\ninto the blood, and become part of body ﬂuids.\\nHormones regulate the ECF concentrations of some\\nelectrolytes. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of\\nNa\\n/H11001ions and the excretion of K/H11001ions by the kidneys.\\nThe blood sodium level is thereby raised, and the\\nblood potassium level is lowered. ANP increases\\nthe excretion of Na\\n/H11001ions by the kidneys and lowers\\nthe blood sodium level. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)\\nand calcitonin regulate the blood levels of calcium and\\nphosphate. PTH increases the reabsorption of these\\nminerals from bones, and increases their absorption\\nfrom food in the small intestine (vitamin D is also nec-\\nessary). Calcitonin promotes the removal of calcium\\nand phosphate from the blood to form bone matrix.\\nElectrolytes are lost in urine, sweat, and feces.\\nUrine contains the electrolytes that are not reab-\\nsorbed by the kidney tubules; the major one of these is\\nNa\\n/H11001ions. Other electrolytes are present in urine when\\ntheir concentrations in the blood exceed the body’s\\nneed for them.\\nThe most abundant electrolytes in sweat are Na\\n/H11001\\nions and Cl /H11002ions. Electrolytes lost in feces are those\\nthat are not absorbed in either the small intestine or\\ncolon.\\nFluid–Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance 445\\n19Scanlon(p3)-ch19  8/17/06  11:02 AM  Page 445'),\n",

The cells of the kidney tubules can remove\\nexcess hydrogen ions by forming NaH\\n2PO4, which is\\nexcreted in urine. The retained Na/H11001ions are returned\\nto the blood in the peritubular capillaries, along with\\nbicarbonate ions.\\nProtein Buffer System\\nThis buffer system is the most important one in the\\nintracellular ﬂuid. Y ou may recall from Chapter 15\\nthat hemoglobin buffers the hydrogen ions formed\\nduring CO\\n2 transport. The amino acids that make up\\nproteins each have a carboxyl group (COOH) and an\\namine (or amino) group (NH2) and may act as either\\nacids or bases.\\nThe carboxyl group may act as an acid because it\\ncan donate a hydrogen ion (H /H11001) to the ﬂuid to coun-\\nteract increasing alkalinity:\\nThe amine group may act as a base because it can\\npick up an excess hydrogen ion from the ﬂuid to coun-\\nteract increasing acidity:\\nThe buffer systems react within a fraction of a sec-\\nond to prevent drastic pH changes.

Severe\\npulmonary diseases are possible causes of respiratory\\nacidosis. When CO\\n2 cannot be exhaled as fast as it\\nis formed during cell respiration, excess CO 2 results\\nin the formation of excess H /H11001ions, as shown in this\\nreaction:\\nCO2/H11001H2O → H2CO3 → H/H11001/H11001HCO3\\n/H11002\\nThe excess H/H11001ions lower the pH of body ﬂuids.\\nRespiratory alkalosis is far less common but is the\\nresult of breathing more rapidly, which increases the\\namount of CO\\n2 exhaled. Because there are fewer CO2\\nmolecules in the body ﬂuids, fewer H /H11001ions are\\nformed, and pH tends to rise.\\nRespiratory Compensation\\nfor Metabolic pH Changes\\nChanges in pH caused by other than a respiratory dis-\\norder are called metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. In\\neither case, the respiratory system may help prevent a\\ndrastic change in pH.\\nMetabolic acidosis may be caused by kidney dis-\\nease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, excessive diar-\\nrhea or vomiting, or the use of some diuretics. When\\nexcess H\\n/H11001ions are present in body ﬂuids, pH begins\\nto decrease, and this stimulates the respiratory centers\\nin the medulla. The response is to increase the rate of\\nbreathing to exhale more CO\\n2 to decrease H/H11001ion for-\\nmation. This helps raise the pH back toward the nor-\\nmal range.\\nFluid–Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance 449\\nPeritubular\\ncapillary Filtrate\\nRenal tubule\\nNa+ Na+ Na+\\nNa2\\nHCO3\\n– HCO3\\n– H+ H+\\nCO2 H2O\\nHPO4\\nH2CO3/H11341/H11341\\n+\\nBlood Urine\\nNaH2PO4\\nHPO4\\n-2Na+\\nFigure 19–4.

In such cases, respiratory compen-\\nsation is only 50% to 75% effective.\\nRENAL MECHANISMS\\nAs just discussed in Chapter 18, the kidneys help reg-\\nulate the pH of extracellular ﬂuid by excreting or con-\\nserving H\\n/H11001ions and by reabsorbing (or not) Na/H11001ions\\nand HCO 3\\n/H11002ions. One mechanism was depicted in\\nFig. 18–6, and another, involving the phosphate buffer\\nsystem, is shown in Fig. 19–4.\\nThe kidneys have the greatest capacity to buffer an\\nongoing pH change. Although the renal mechanisms\\ndo not become fully functional for several hours to\\ndays, once they do they continue to be effective far\\nlonger than respiratory mechanisms. Let us use as an\\nexample a patient with untreated diabetes mellitus\\nwho is in ketoacidosis, a metabolic acidosis. As acidic\\nketones accumulate in the blood, the capacity of the\\nextracellular ﬂuid (ECF) buffer systems is quickly\\nexhausted. Breathing rate then increases, and more\\nCO\\n2 is exhaled to decrease H/H11001ion formation and raise\\nthe pH of ECF . There is, however, a limit to how\\nmuch the respiratory rate can increase, but the renal\\nbuffering mechanisms will then become effective. At\\nthis time it is the kidneys that are keeping the patient\\nalive by preventing acidosis from reaching a fatal level.\\nEven the kidneys have limits, however, and the cause\\nof the acidosis must be corrected to prevent death.\\nEFFECTS OF pH CHANGES\\nA state of acidosis is most detrimental to the central\\nnervous system, causing depression of impulse trans-\\nmission at synapses. A person in acidosis becomes con-\\nfused and disoriented, then lapses into a coma.\\nAlkalosis has the opposite effect and affects both\\nthe central and peripheral nervous systems.

Water makes up 55% to 75% of the total body\\nweight.\\n2. Electrolytes are the ions found in body ﬂuids; most\\nare minerals.\\nWater Compartments (see Fig. 19–1)\\n1. Intracellular ﬂuid (ICF)—water within cells; about\\ntwo-thirds of total body water.\\n2. Extracellular ﬂuid (ECF)—water outside cells;\\nincludes plasma, lymph, tissue ﬂuid, and specialized\\nﬂuids.\\n3. Water constantly moves from one compartment\\nto another. Filtration: plasma becomes tissue ﬂuid.\\nOsmosis: tissue ﬂuid becomes plasma, or lymph, or\\nICF .\\n4. Osmosis is regulated by the concentration of elec-\\ntrolytes in body ﬂuids (osmolarity). Water will dif-\\nfuse through membranes to areas of greater\\nelectrolyte concentration.\\nWater Intake (see Fig. 19–2)\\n1. Fluids, food, metabolic water—see T able 19–1.\\nWater Output (see Fig. 19–2)\\n1. Urine, sweat, exhaled air, feces—see T able 19–1.\\n2. Any variation in output must be compensated for\\nby a change in input.\\nRegulation of Water Intake and Output\\n1. Hypothalamus contains osmoreceptors that detect\\nchanges in osmolarity of body ﬂuids.\\n2. Dehydration stimulates the sensation of thirst, and\\nﬂuids are consumed to relieve it.\\n3. ADH released from the posterior pituitary\\nincreases the reabsorption of water by the kidneys.\\n4. Aldosterone secreted by the adrenal cortex\\nincreases the reabsorption of Na\\n/H11001ions by the kid-\\nneys; water is then reabsorbed by osmosis.\\n5. If there is too much water in the body, secretion of\\nADH decreases, and urinary output increases.\\n6. If blood volume increases, ANP promotes loss of\\nNa/H11001ions and water in urine.\\nElectrolytes\\n1. Chemicals that dissolve in water and dissociate into\\nions; most are inorganic.\\n2. Cations are positive ions such as Na /H11001and K/H11001.\\n3. Anions are negative ions such as Cl /H11002and HCO3\\n/H11002.\\n4. By creating osmotic pressure, electrolytes regulate\\nthe osmosis of water between compartments.\\nElectrolytes in Body Fluids (see Fig. 19–3 and\\nTable 19–2)\\n1. ICF—principal cation is K\\n/H11001; principal anion is\\nHPO4\\n/H110022; protein anions are also abundant.\\n2. Plasma—principal cation is Na /H11001; principal anion is\\nCl/H11002; protein anions are signiﬁcant.\\n3. Tissue ﬂuid—same as plasma except that protein\\nanions are insigniﬁcant.\\nIntake, Output, and Regulation\\n1. Intake—electrolytes are part of food and beverages.\\n2. Output—urine, sweat, feces.\\n3. Hormones involved: aldosterone—Na\\n/H11001and K /H11001;\\nANP—Na/H11001; PTH and calcitonin—Ca /H110012 and\\nHPO4\\n/H110022.\\nAcid–Base Balance\\n1.

Normal pH of body ﬂuids is maintained by buffer\\nsystems, respirations, and the kidneys.\\nBuffer Systems\\n1.

How dry and impersonal that\\nsounds, until we remember that each of us is a contin-\\nuation of our species and that many of us in turn will\\nhave our own children. Although some other animals\\ncare for their offspring in organized families or soci-\\neties, the human species is unique, because of cultural\\ninﬂuences, in the attention we give to reproduction\\nand to family life.\\nY et like other animals, the actual production and\\ngrowth of offspring is a matter of our anatomy and\\nphysiology. The male and female reproductive systems\\nproduce gametes, that is, sperm and egg cells, and\\nensure the union of gametes in fertilization following\\nsexual intercourse. In women, the uterus provides the\\nsite for the developing embryo/fetus until it is suffi-\\nciently developed to survive outside the womb.\\nThis chapter will describe the organs of reproduc-\\ntion and the role of each in the creation of new life or\\nthe functioning of the reproductive system as a whole.\\nFirst, however, we will discuss the formation of\\ngametes.\\nMEIOSIS\\nThe cell division process of meiosis produces the\\ngametes—sperm or egg cells. In meiosis, one cell with\\nthe diploid number of chromosomes (46 for humans)\\ndivides twice to form four cells, each with the haploid\\nnumber of chromosomes. Haploid means half the usual\\ndiploid number, so for humans the haploid number is\\n23. Although the process of meiosis is essentially the\\nsame in men and women, there are some important\\ndifferences.\\nSPERMATOGENESIS\\nSpermatogenesis is the process of meiosis as it takes\\nplace in the testes, the site of sperm production.\\nWithin each testis are seminiferous tubules that\\ncontain spermatogonia, which are stem cells that gen-\\nerate sperm. A spermatogonium divides by mitosis to\\nform two cells, one of which will remain in place as a\\nstem cell, while the other differentiates (specializes) to\\nbecome a primary spermatocyte that will undergo\\nmeiosis (Fig. 20–1). As you may recall from Chapter\\n10, gamete formation is regulated by hormones.\\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior\\npituitary gland initiates sperm production, and testos-\\nterone, secreted by the testes when stimulated by\\nluteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary,\\npromotes the maturation of sperm. Inhibin, also pro-\\nduced by the testes, decreases the secretion of FSH. As\\nyou can see in Fig. 20–1, for each primary spermato-\\ncyte that undergoes meiosis, four functional sperm\\ncells are produced.\\nSperm production begins at puberty (10 to 14\\nyears of age), and millions of sperm are formed each\\nday in the testes. Although sperm production dimin-\\nishes with advancing age, there is usually no complete\\ncessation, as there is of egg production in women at\\nmenopause.\\nOOGENESIS\\nOogenesis is the process of meiosis for egg cell for-\\nmation; it begins in the ovaries and is also regulated by\\nhormones. FSH initiates the growth of ovarian folli-\\ncles, each of which contains an oogonium, a stem cell\\nfor egg cell production (Fig. 20–2). This hormone also\\nstimulates the follicle cells to secrete estrogen, which\\npromotes the maturation of the ovum. Notice that for\\neach primary oocyte that undergoes meiosis, only one\\nfunctional egg cell is produced. The other three cells\\nproduced are called polar bodies. They have no func-\\ntion, and will simply deteriorate. A mature ovarian fol-\\nlicle actually contains the secondary oocyte; the\\nsecond meiotic division will take place if and when the\\negg is fertilized.\\nThe production of ova begins at puberty (10 to 14\\nyears of age) and continues until menopause (45 to 55\\nyears of age), when the ovaries atrophy and no longer\\nrespond to pituitary hormones. During this 30- to 40-\\nyear span, egg production is cyclical, with a mature\\novum being produced approximately every 28 days\\n(the menstrual cycle is discussed later in this chapter).\\nActually, several follicles usually begin to develop\\nduring each cycle. However, the rupturing (ovulation)\\nof the ﬁrst follicle to mature stops the growth of the\\nothers.\\nThe process of meiosis is like other human proces-\\nses in that “mistakes” may sometimes occur. One of\\nthese, trisomy, is discussed in Box 20–1: T risomy and\\nDown Syndrome.\\nThe haploid egg and sperm cells produced by\\nmeiosis each have 23 chromosomes.

Thus, meiosis maintains the\\ndiploid number of the human species by reducing the\\nnumber of chromosomes by half in the formation of\\ngametes.\\nMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM\\nThe male reproductive system consists of the testes\\nand a series of ducts and glands. Sperm are produced\\nin the testes and are transported through the repro-\\nductive ducts: epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory\\nduct, and urethra (Fig. 20–3). The reproductive glands\\nproduce secretions that become part of semen, the\\nﬂuid that is ejaculated from the urethra. These glands\\nare the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bul-\\nbourethral glands.\\nTESTES\\nThe testes are located in the scrotum, a sac of skin\\nbetween the upper thighs. The temperature within\\nthe scrotum is about 96 /H11034F , slightly lower than body\\ntemperature, which is necessary for the production\\nof viable sperm. In the male fetus, the testes develop\\nnear the kidneys, then descend into the scrotum just\\nbefore birth. Cryptorchidism is the condition in\\nwhich the testes fail to descend, and the result is\\nsterility unless the testes are surgically placed in the\\nscrotum.\\nThe Reproductive Systems 457\\nMitosis\\nSpermatogonium\\nStem cell\\nNew stem cell\\nFigure 20–1.

Both of these trisomies are\\ncharacterized by severe mental and physical retar-\\ndation, heart defects, deafness, and bone abnor-\\nmalities. Affected infants usually die within their ﬁrst\\nyear.\\nDown syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the most\\ncommon trisomy, with a frequency of about one\\nper 750 live births. Children with Down syndrome\\nare mentally retarded, but there is a great range of\\nmental ability in this group. Physical characteristics\\ninclude a skin fold above each eye, short stature,\\npoor muscle tone, and heart defects. Again, the\\ndegree of severity is highly variable.\\nWomen over the age of 35 are believed to be at\\ngreater risk of having a child with Down syndrome.\\nThe reason may be that as egg cells age the process\\nof meiosis is more likely to proceed incorrectly.\\nTrisomy means the presence of three (rather than\\nthe normal two) of a particular chromosome in the\\ncells of an individual. This may occur because of\\nnon-disjunction (nonseparation) of a chromosome\\npair during the second meiotic division, usually in\\nan egg cell. The egg cell has two of a particular\\nchromosome, and if fertilized by a sperm, will then\\ncontain three of that chromosome, and a total of\\n47 chromosomes.\\nMost trisomies are probably lethal; that is, the\\naffected embryo will quickly die, even before the\\nwoman realizes she is pregnant. When an embryo-\\nfetus survives and a child is born with a trisomy,\\ndevelopmental defects are always present.\\nThe severity of trisomies may be seen in two of\\nthe more rarely occurring ones: Trisomy 13 and\\nTrisomy 18, each of which occurs about once for\\n458\\n20Scanlon(p3)-ch20  8/17/06  11:02 AM  Page 458'),\n",

This canal is an opening in the abdominal wall\\nfor the spermatic cord , a connective tissue sheath\\nthat contains the ductus deferens, testicular blood\\nvessels, and nerves. Because the inguinal canal is an\\nopening in a muscular wall, it is a natural “weak spot,”\\nand it is the most common site of hernia formation in\\nmen.\\nOnce inside the abdominal cavity, the ductus defer-\\nens extends upward over the urinary bladder, then\\ndown the posterior side to join the ejaculatory duct on\\nits own side (see Fig. 20–3). The smooth muscle layer\\nof the ductus deferens contracts in waves of peristalsis\\nas part of ejaculation (see Box 20–2: Contraception).\\nEJACULATORY DUCTS\\nEach of the two ejaculatory ducts receives sperm\\nfrom the ductus deferens and the secretion of the sem-\\ninal vesicle on its own side.

The\\nuse of a spermicide (sperm-killing chemical)\\nincreases the effectiveness of these methods. A con-\\ndom is a latex or rubber sheath that covers the\\npenis and collects and contains ejaculated semen.\\nLeakage is possible, however, and the condom is\\nconsidered 80% to 90% effective.

The penis is an external genital\\norgan; its distal end is called the glans penis and is cov-\\nered with a fold of skin called the prepuce or foreskin.\\nCircumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin.\\nThis is a common procedure performed on male\\ninfants, and though there is considerable medical\\ndebate as to whether circumcision has a useful pur-\\npose, some research studies have found fewer cases of\\nHIV infection among circumcised men, compared\\nwith men who are uncircumcised.\\nWithin the penis are three masses of cavernous\\n(erectile) tissue (see Fig. 20–3).

During sexual stimulation, the\\narteries to the penis dilate, the sinuses ﬁll with blood,\\nand the penis becomes erect and ﬁrm. The dilation of\\npenile arteries and the resulting erection are brought\\nabout by the localized release of nitric oxide (NO) and\\nby parasympathetic impulses. The erect penis is capa-\\nble of penetrating the female vagina to deposit sperm.\\nThe culmination of sexual stimulation is ejaculation, a\\nsympathetic response that is brought about by peristal-\\nsis of all of the reproductive ducts and contraction of\\nthe prostate gland and the muscles of the pelvic ﬂoor.\\nSEMEN\\nSemen consists of sperm and the secretions of the\\nseminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral\\nglands; its average pH is about 7.4.

As with sperm pro-\\nduction in men, the supply of potential gametes far\\nexceeds what is actually needed, but this helps ensure\\nthe continuation of the human species.\\nEach primary ovarian follicle contains an oocyte, a\\npotential ovum or egg cell. Surrounding the oocyte\\nare the follicle cells, which secrete estrogen. Matura-\\ntion of a follicle, requiring FSH and estrogen, was\\ndescribed previously in the section on oogenesis. A\\nmature follicle may also be called a graaﬁan follicle,\\nand the hormone LH from the anterior pituitary\\ngland causes ovulation, that is, rupture of the mature\\nfollicle with release of the ovum.

The sweeping action of the cilia also\\nmoves the ovum toward the uterus.\\nFertilization usually takes place in the fallopian\\ntube. If not fertilized, an ovum dies within 24 to 48\\nhours and disintegrates, either in the tube or the\\nuterus. If fertilized, the ovum becomes a zygote and is\\nswept into the uterus; this takes about 4 to 5 days (see\\nBox 20–4: In Vitro Fertilization).\\nSometimes the zygote will not reach the uterus but\\nwill still continue to develop. This is called an ectopic\\npregnancy; ectopic means “in an abnormal site.” The\\ndeveloping embryo may become implanted in the fal-\\nlopian tube, the ovary itself, or even elsewhere in the\\nabdominal cavity. An ectopic pregnancy usually does\\nnot progress very long, because these other sites are\\nnot specialized to provide a placenta or to expand to\\naccommodate the growth of a fetus, as the uterus is.\\nThe spontaneous termination of an ectopic pregnancy\\nis usually the result of bleeding in the mother, and sur-\\ngery may be necessary to prevent maternal death from\\ncirculatory shock. Occasionally an ectopic pregnancy\\ndoes go to full term and produces a healthy baby; such\\nan event is a credit to the adaptability of the human\\nbody and to the advances of medical science.\\nUTERUS\\nThe uterus is shaped like an upside-down pear, about\\n3 inches long by 2 inches wide by 1 inch deep (7.5 cm\\nby 5 cm by 2.5 cm), superior to the urinary bladder\\nand between the two ovaries in the pelvic cavity\\n(see Fig. 20–5). The broad ligament also covers the\\nuterus (see Fig. 20–6). During pregnancy the uterus\\nincreases greatly in size, contains the placenta to nour-\\nish the embryo-fetus, and expels the baby at the end of\\ngestation.\\nThe parts and layers of the uterus are shown in Fig.\\n20–6. The fundus is the upper portion above the\\nentry of the fallopian tubes, and the body is the large\\ncentral portion. The narrow, lower end of the uterus is\\nthe cervix, which opens into the vagina.\\nThe outermost layer of the uterus, the serosa or\\nepimetrium, is a fold of the peritoneum. The myome-\\ntrium is the smooth muscle layer; during pregnancy\\nthese cells increase in size to accommodate the grow-\\ning fetus and contract for labor and delivery at the end\\nof pregnancy.\\nThe lining of the uterus is the endometrium,\\nwhich itself consists of two layers. The basilar layer,\\nadjacent to the myometrium, is vascular but very\\nthin and is a permanent layer. The functional layer\\nis regenerated and lost during each menstrual cycle.\\nUnder the inﬂuence of estrogen and progesterone\\nfrom the ovaries, the growth of blood vessels thick-\\nens the functional layer in preparation for a possible\\nembryo. If fertilization does not occur, the functional\\nlayer sloughs off in menstruation. During pregnancy,\\nthe endometrium forms the maternal portion of the\\nplacenta.\\nVAGINA\\nThe vagina is a muscular tube about 4 inches (10 cm)\\nlong that extends from the cervix to the vaginal oriﬁce\\nin the perineum (pelvic ﬂoor).

Menstrual phase —The loss of the functional\\nlayer of the endometrium is called menstruation\\nor the menses. Although this is actually the end of\\na menstrual cycle, the onset of menstruation is eas-\\nily pinpointed and is, therefore, a useful starting\\npoint. Menstruation may last 2 to 8 days, with an\\naverage of 3 to 6 days. At this time, secretion of\\nFSH is increasing, and several ovarian follicles\\nbegin to develop.\\n2. Follicular phase —FSH stimulates growth of\\novarian follicles and secretion of estrogen by the\\nfollicle cells. The secretion of LH is also in-\\ncreasing, but more slowly. FSH and estrogen pro-\\nmote the growth and maturation of the ovum, and\\nestrogen stimulates the growth of blood vessels in\\nthe endometrium to regenerate the functional\\nlayer.\\nThis phase ends with ovulation, when a sharp\\nincrease in LH causes rupture of a mature ovarian\\nfollicle.\\n3. Luteal phase —Under the inﬂuence of LH, the\\nruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum and\\nbegins to secrete progesterone as well as estrogen.\\nProgesterone stimulates further growth of blood\\nvessels in the functional layer of the endometrium\\nand promotes the storage of nutrients such as\\nglycogen.\\nAs progesterone secretion increases, LH secre-\\ntion decreases, and if the ovum is not fertilized, the\\nsecretion of progesterone also begins to decrease.\\nWithout progesterone, the endometrium cannot be\\nmaintained and begins to slough off in menstrua-\\ntion. FSH secretion begins to increase (as estrogen\\nand progesterone decrease), and the cycle begins\\nagain.\\nAlso secreted by the corpus luteum during a cycle\\nare the hormones inhibin and relaxin. Inhibin inhibits\\nthe secretion of FSH, and perhaps LH as well, from\\nthe anterior pituitary gland. Relaxin is believed to\\ninhibit contractions of the myometrium (as does pro-\\ngesterone), which would help make implantation of\\nthe early embryo successful.\\nThe 28-day cycle shown in Fig. 20–9 is average.\\nWomen may have cycles of anywhere from 23 to 35\\ndays, the normal range.

Estrogen secre-\\ntion decreases; ovulation and menstrual cycles become\\nirregular and ﬁnally cease. The decrease in estrogen\\nhas other effects as well. Loss of bone matrix may lead\\nto osteoporosis and fractures; an increase in blood\\ncholesterol makes women more likely to develop\\ncoronary artery disease; drying of the vaginal mucosa\\nincreases susceptibility to vaginal infections. Estrogen\\nreplacement therapy may delay some of these conse-\\nquences of menopause, but there are risks involved,\\nand women should be fully informed of them before\\nstarting such therapy. The likelihood of breast cancer\\nalso increases with age, and women over age 50 should\\nconsider having a mammogram to serve as a baseline,\\nthen one at least every other year.\\nFor most men, testosterone secretion continues\\nthroughout life, as does sperm production, though\\nboth diminish with advancing age. Perhaps the most\\ncommon reproductive problem for older men is pro-\\nstatic hypertrophy, enlargement of the prostate gland.\\nAs the urethra is compressed by the growing prostate\\ngland, urination becomes difficult, and residual urine\\nin the bladder increases the chance of urinary tract\\ninfection. Prostate hypertrophy is usually benign, but\\ncancer of the prostate is one of the more common can-\\ncers in elderly men.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe production of male or female gametes is a process\\nthat is regulated by hormones. When fertilization of\\nan ovum by a sperm cell takes place, the zygote, or fer-\\ntilized egg, has the potential to become a new human\\nbeing. The development of the zygote to embryo-\\nfetus to newborn infant is also dependent on hor-\\nmones and is the subject of our next chapter.\\n470 The Reproductive Systems\\nTable 20–3 HORMONES OF FEMALE REPRODUCTION\\nHormone Secreted by Functions\\nFSH\\nLH\\nEstrogen*\\nProgesterone\\nInhibin\\nRelaxin\\n*Estrogen has effects on organs such as bones and blood vessels in both men and women.

Although a child may\\nnot resemble either parent, there is a sound basis for\\nsuch comparisons, because the genetic makeup and\\nmany of the traits of a child are the result of the chro-\\nmosomes inherited from mother and father.\\nIn this chapter, we will cover some of the funda-\\nmentals of genetics and inheritance. First, however,\\nwe will look at the development of a fertilized egg into\\na functioning human being.\\nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT\\nDuring the 40 weeks of gestation, the embryo-fetus is\\nprotected and nourished in the uterus of the mother.\\nA human being begins life as one cell, a fertilized egg\\ncalled a zygote, which develops into an individual\\nhuman being consisting of billions of cells organized\\ninto the body systems with whose functions you are\\nnow quite familiar.\\nFERTILIZATION\\nAlthough millions of sperm are deposited in the\\nvagina during sexual intercourse, only one will fertil-\\nize an ovum. As the sperm swim through the ﬂuid of\\nthe uterus and fallopian tube, they undergo a ﬁnal\\nmetabolic change, called capacitation. This change\\ninvolves the acrosome, which becomes more fragile.\\nWhen sperm and egg make contact, the acrosomal\\nenzymes will digest the layers of cells and membrane\\naround an ovum.\\nOnce a sperm nucleus enters the ovum, changes in\\nthe egg cell membrane block the entry of other sperm.\\nThe nucleus of the ovum completes the second mei-\\notic division, and the nuclei of ovum and sperm fuse,\\nrestoring the diploid number of chromosomes in the\\nzygote.\\nThe human diploid number of 46 chromosomes is\\nactually 23 pairs of chromosomes; 23 from the sperm\\nand 23 from the egg. These 23 pairs consist of 22 pairs\\nof autosomes (designated by the numerals 1 through\\n22) and one pair of sex chromosomes. Women have\\nthe sex chromosomes XX, and men have the sex chro-\\nmosomes XY. Figure 21–1 shows the inheritance of\\ngender. The Y chromosome has a gene that triggers\\nthe development of male gonads in the embryo. In the\\nabsence of the Y chromosome, the embryo will\\ndevelop as a female.\\nIMPLANTATION\\nFertilization usually takes place within the fallopian\\ntube, and the zygote begins to divide even as it is being\\nswept toward the uterus. These are mitotic divisions\\nand are called cleavage. Refer to Fig. 21–2 as you read\\nthe following.\\nThe single-cell zygote divides into a two-cell stage,\\nfour-cell stage, eight-cell stage, and so on. Three days\\nafter fertilization there are 16 cells, which continue to\\ndivide to form a solid sphere of cells called a morula\\n(see Box 21–1: T wins). As mitosis proceeds, this sphere\\nbecomes hollow and is called a blastocyst, which is\\nstill about the same size as the original zygote.\\nA ﬂuid-ﬁlled blastocyst consists of an outer layer of\\ncells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass that\\ncontains the potential embryo. It is the blastocyst stage\\nthat becomes implanted in the uterine wall, about 5 to\\n8 days after fertilization.\\nSuccessful implantation is not simply a matter of the\\nblastocyst contacting the uterine lining. The endo-\\nmetrium produces carbohydrate “docking” molecules\\ntoward the end of the uterine cycle, and the blastocyst\\nhas a surface protein that ﬁts the docking sites. Once\\nthis “ﬁt” is made, the trophoblast secretes enzymes to\\ndigest the surface of the endometrium, creating a small\\ncrater into which the blastocyst sinks. The trophoblast\\nwill become the chorion, the embryonic membrane\\nthat will form the fetal portion of the placenta.\\nFollowing implantation, the inner cell mass will grow\\nto become the embryo and other membranes.\\nThe cells of the inner cell mass are embryonic stem\\ncells. In these cells, all of the DNA has the potential\\nfor being switched on, that is, the potential exists for a\\ncell to develop into any of the 200 kinds of human\\ncells that will be present at birth. As the cells continue\\nto divide and become more numerous, some DNA\\nwill be switched off in each cell, genes will become\\ninactive, and the possibilities for the specialization of\\neach cell will be narrowed down. The “switches” are\\nchemicals, few of which are known at present. A great\\ndeal of research is focusing on discovering the stimuli\\nthat turn a stem cell into a muscle cell rather than a\\nnerve cell or skin cell, and so on.\\n476 Human Development and Genetics\\n21Scanlon(p3)-ch21  8/17/06  11:04 AM  Page 476'),\n",

Several stages of early embryonic development\\nare shown in Fig. 21–3. At approximately 12 days, the\\nembryonic disc (the potential person) is simply a\\nplate of cells within the blastocyst. As cells keep divid-\\ning, the plate of cells begins to fold. At 14 days twin-\\nning is believed to be no longer possible.\\nVery soon thereafter, three primary layers, or germ\\nlayers, begin to develop: the ectoderm, mesoderm,\\nand endoderm. This is a major step in the specializa-\\ntion of the embryo cells, because different sets of\\ngenes are switched off for each of the three layers,\\nwhile the genes appropriate for the layer remain\\nswitched on. Each cell is now committed to a particu-\\nlar layer and can no longer “go back,” that is, become\\na cell of either of the other two layers.\\nEach primary layer develops further; its cells\\nbecome more specialized as more and more genes in\\neach cell are switched off. With the active genes, those\\nthat remain switched on, the cells in each layer are\\nthereby committed to develop into speciﬁc organs or\\nparts of organs. Ecto means “outer”; the epidermis is\\nderived from ectoderm, and in some of these cells the\\ngene for producing keratin is active. Meso means “mid-\\ndle”; the skeletal muscles develop from mesoderm,\\nand in these cells the genes for producing myosin and\\nactin are active. Endo means “inner”; the stomach lin-\\ning is derived from endoderm, and in these cells, the\\ngene for producing pepsinogen is active. T able 21–1\\nlists some other structures derived from each of the\\nprimary germ layers.\\nAt 20 days, the embryonic membranes can be\\nclearly distinguished from the embryo itself. The yolk\\nsac does not contain nutrient yolk, as it does for bird\\nand reptile embryos. It is, however, the site for the for-\\nmation of the ﬁrst blood cells and the cells that will\\nbecome spermatogonia or oogonia. As the embryo\\ngrows, the yolk sac membrane is incorporated into the\\numbilical cord.\\nThe amnion is a thin membrane that eventually\\nsurrounds the embryo and contains amniotic ﬂuid .\\nThis ﬂuid provides a cushion for the fetus against\\nmechanical injury as the mother moves.

The period of\\nembryonic growth continues until the 8th week. At\\nthis time, all of the organ systems have been estab-\\nlished. They will continue to grow and mature until\\nthe end of gestation. The period of fetal growth\\nextends from the 9th through the 40th week. T able\\n21–2 lists some of the major aspects of development in\\nthe growth of the embryo-fetus. The fetus at 16 weeks\\nis depicted in Fig. 21–4 (see Box 21–3: Congenital\\nFetal Infections, and Box 21–4: Fetal Alcohol\\nSyndrome). Maternal changes during pregnancy are\\nsummarized in T able 21–3.\\nPLACENTA AND UMBILICAL CORD\\nThe placenta is made of both fetal and maternal tis-\\nsue. The chorion of the embryo and the endometrium\\nof the uterus contribute, and the placenta is formed\\nby the third month of gestation (12 weeks). The\\nmature placenta is a ﬂat disc about 7 inches (17 cm) in\\ndiameter.\\nThe structure of a small portion of the placenta is\\nshown in Fig. 21–5. Notice that the fetal blood vessels\\nare within maternal blood sinuses, but there is no\\ndirect connection between fetal and maternal vessels.\\nNormally, the blood of the fetus does not mix with\\nthat of the mother. The placenta has two functions: to\\nbe the site of exchanges between maternal and fetal\\nblood and to produce hormones to maintain preg-\\nnancy. We will consider the exchanges ﬁrst.\\nThe fetus is dependent upon the mother for oxygen\\nand nutrients and for the removal of waste products.\\nThe umbilical cord connects the fetus to the pla-\\ncenta. Within the cord are two umbilical arteries that\\ncarry blood from the fetus to the placenta and one\\numbilical vein that returns blood from the placenta to\\nthe fetus.\\nWhen blood in the umbilical arteries enters the\\nplacenta, CO\\n2 and waste products in the fetal capillar-\\nies diffuse into the maternal blood sinuses. Oxygen\\ndiffuses from the maternal blood sinuses into the fetal\\ncapillaries; nutrients enter the fetal blood by diffusion\\nand active transport mechanisms.

The secretion of progesterone is partic-\\nularly important to prevent contractions of the\\nmyometrium, which would otherwise result in miscar-\\nriage of the embryo. Once hCG enters maternal cir-\\nculation, it is excreted in urine, which is the basis for\\nmany pregnancy tests. T ests for hCG in maternal\\nblood are even more precise and can determine\\nwhether a pregnancy has occurred even before a men-\\nstrual period is missed.\\nThe corpus luteum is a small structure, however,\\nand cannot secrete sufficient amounts of estrogen and\\nprogesterone to maintain a full-term pregnancy. The\\nplacenta itself begins to secrete estrogen and proges-\\nterone within a few weeks, and the levels of these hor-\\nmones increase until birth. As the placenta takes over,\\nthe secretion of hCG decreases, and the corpus\\nluteum becomes non-functional. During pregnancy,\\nestrogen and progesterone inhibit the anterior pitu-\\nitary secretion of FSH and LH, so no other ovarian\\nfollicles develop. These placental hormones also pre-\\npare the mammary glands for lactation.\\nThe placenta also secretes relaxin, which helps\\ninhibit contractions of the myometrium. Relaxin also\\npermits stretching of the ligaments of the pubic sym-\\nphysis so that this joint will give a little, if necessary,\\nduring birth.\\nPARTURITION AND LABOR\\nParturition is the rather formal term for birth, and\\nlabor is the sequence of events that occur during\\nbirth.

It is important to remember that no inva-\\nsive procedure is without risks.\\nMaternal Blood Tests\\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the fetus\\nand is found in maternal circulation. The level\\nreaches a peak between 12 and 15 weeks of gesta-\\ntion, and should then decrease.

If infection occurs\\ntoward the end of gestation, the child may be born\\nwith syphilis. This is most often apparent as a rash on\\nthe skin and mucous membranes. Syphilis in adults\\ncan be cured by penicillin; prevention of congenital\\nsyphilis depends upon good prenatal care for\\nwomen who may be infected.

These chromosomes\\nare in 23 pairs called homologous pairs. One mem-\\nber of each pair has come from the egg and is called\\nmaternal, the other member has come from the sperm\\nand is called paternal. The autosomes are the chromo-\\nsome pairs designated 1 to 22. The sex chromosomes\\nform the remaining pair. In women these are desig-\\nnated XX and in men XY.\\nChromosomes are made of DNA and protein; the\\nDNA is the hereditary material. Y ou may wish to refer\\nto Chapter 3 to review DNA structure. The sequence\\nof bases in the DNA of chromosomes is the genetic\\ncode for proteins, structural proteins as well as\\nenzymes. The DNA code for one protein is called a\\ngene. For example, a speciﬁc region of the DNA of\\nchromosome 11 is the code for the beta chain of\\nhemoglobin. Because an individual has two of chro-\\nmosome 11, he or she will have two genes for this pro-\\ntein, a maternal gene inherited from the mother and a\\npaternal gene inherited from the father. This is true\\nfor virtually all of the 20,000 to 25,000 genes estimated\\nto be found in our chromosomes. In our genetic\\nmakeup, each of us has two genes for each protein.\\nGENOTYPE AND PHENOTYPE\\nFor each gene of a pair, there may be two or more pos-\\nsibilities for its “expression,” that is, how it will appear\\nor how it will affect the individual. These possibilities\\nare called alleles. A person, therefore, may be said to\\nhave two alleles for each protein or trait; the alleles\\nmay be the same or may be different.\\nIf the two alleles are the same, the person is said to\\nbe homozygous for the trait. If the two alleles are dif-\\nferent, the person is said to be heterozygous for the\\ntrait.\\nThe genotype is the actual genetic makeup, that is,\\nthe alleles present. The phenotype is the appearance,\\nor how the alleles are expressed. When a gene has two\\nor more alleles, one allele may be dominant over the\\nother, which is called recessive. For a person who is\\nheterozygous for a trait, the dominant allele (or gene)\\nis the one that will appear in the phenotype. The\\nrecessive allele (or gene) is hidden but is not lost, and\\nmay be passed to children. For a recessive trait to be\\nexpressed in the phenotype, the person must be\\nhomozygous recessive, that is, have two recessive al-\\nleles (genes) for the trait.\\nAn example will be helpful here to put all this\\ntogether and is illustrated in Fig. 21–7. When doing\\ngenetics problems, a Punnett square is used to show\\nthe possible combinations of genes in the egg and\\nsperm for a particular set of parents and their children.\\nRemember that an egg or sperm has only 23 chromo-\\nsomes and, therefore, has only one gene for each trait.\\nIn this example, the inheritance of eye color has\\nbeen simpliﬁed. Although eye color is determined by\\nmany pairs of genes, with many possible phenotypes,\\none pair is considered the principal pair, with brown\\neyes dominant over blue eyes. A dominant gene is usu-\\nally represented by a capital letter, and the correspon-\\nding recessive gene is represented by the same letter,\\nbut lowercase. The parents in Fig. 21–7 are both het-\\nerozygous for eye color. Their genotype consists of a\\ngene for brown eyes and a gene for blue eyes, but their\\nphenotype is brown eyes.\\nEach egg produced by the mother has a 50%\\nchance of containing the gene for brown eyes, or an\\nequal 50% chance of containing the gene for blue eyes.\\nSimilarly, each sperm produced by the father has a\\n50% chance of containing the gene for brown eyes and\\na 50% chance of containing the gene for blue eyes.\\nNow look at the boxes of the Punnett square; these\\nrepresent the possibilities for the genetic makeup of\\neach child. For eye color there are three possibilities:\\na 25% (one of four) chance for homozygous brown\\neyes, a 50% (two of four) chance for heterozygous\\nbrown eyes, and a 25% (one of four) chance for\\nhomozygous blue eyes. Notice that BB and Bb have\\nthe same phenotype (brown eyes) despite their differ-\\nent genotypes, and that the phenotype of blue eyes is\\npossible only with the genotype bb. Can brown-eyed\\nparents have a blue-eyed child? Y es; if each parent is\\nheterozygous for brown eyes, each child has a 25%\\nchance of inheriting blue eyes. Could these parents\\nhave four children with blue eyes? What is the proba-\\nbility or chance of this happening? The answers to\\nthese questions will be found in Box 21–7: Solution to\\nGenetics Question.\\nINHERITANCE: DOMINANT–RECESSIVE\\nThe inheritance of eye color just described is an exam-\\nple of a trait determined by a pair of alleles, one\\nof which may dominate the other.

The Punnett\\nsquare in Fig. 21–8 shows that if both parents are het-\\nerozygous, each child has a 25% chance (1 of 4) of\\ninheriting the two recessive genes. T able 21–4 lists\\nsome other human genetic diseases and their patterns\\nof inheritance.\\nIt is important to remember that in the terminol-\\nogy of genetics, dominant does not mean “common”\\nor “frequent.” It simply means that one gene is suffi-\\ncient for the characteristic to appear in the phenotype.\\nThink back to the ABO blood types. Which type is the\\nmost common in a population? T ype O is most com-\\nmon, followed by type A, then type B. T ype AB is the\\nleast common. Here is an instance in which the reces-\\nsive trait, type O, is most frequent in a group of peo-\\nple. Why is type AB the least common, even though A\\nand B alleles are dominant over an O allele?

If you look at\\nT able 21–6 later in this chapter, you will certainly be\\nable to ﬁnd other dominant traits that are rare.\\nINHERITANCE: MULTIPLE ALLELES\\nThe best example of this pattern of inheritance is the\\nhuman blood type of the ABO group. For each gene\\nof this blood type, there are three possible alleles: A,\\nB, or O. A person will have only two of these alleles,\\nwhich may be the same or different. O is the recessive\\nallele; A and B are co-dominant alleles, that is, domi-\\nnant over O but not over each other.\\nY ou already know that in this blood group there are\\nfour possible blood types: O, AB, A, and B. T able 21–5\\nshows the combinations of alleles for each type.\\nNotice that for types O and AB there is only one pos-\\nsible genotype. For types A and B, however, there are\\ntwo possible genotypes, because both A and B alleles\\nare dominant over an O allele.\\nLet us now use a problem to illustrate the inheri-\\ntance of blood type. The Punnett square in Fig. 21–9\\nshows that Mom has type O blood and Dad has type\\nAB blood. The boxes of the square show the possible\\nblood types for each child. Each child has a 50%\\nchance of having type A blood, and a 50% chance of\\nhaving type B blood. The genotype, however, will\\nalways be heterozygous. Notice that in this example,\\nthe blood types of the children will not be the same as\\nthose of the parents. (The Rh factor is inherited inde-\\npendently of the ABO type, and is of the dominant–\\nrecessive pattern. Rh positive is dominant and Rh\\nnegative is recessive.)\\nT able 21–6 lists some other human genetic traits,\\nwith the dominant and recessive phenotype for each.\\nINHERITANCE: SEX-LINKED TRAITS\\nSex-linked traits may also be called X-linked traits\\nbecause the genes for them are located only on the X\\nchromosome. The Y does not have corresponding\\ngenes for many of the genes on the X chromosome.\\n(The Y chromosome is very small and has only about\\n20 genes. Some of these genes are active only in the\\ntestes and contribute to spermatogenesis. Others are\\nactive in many body cells, but their functions are not\\nyet known with certainty.)\\nThe genes for sex-linked traits are recessive, but\\nbecause there are no corresponding genes on the Y\\nchromosome to mask them, a man needs only one\\ngene to express one of these traits in his phenotype.

Therefore, it is important to\\nlearn both genus and species names of important\\npathogens.\\nNORMAL FLORA\\nEach of us has a natural population of microorganisms\\nliving on and within us. This is our normal ﬂora.\\nThese microbes may be further categorized as resi-\\ndents or transients. Resident ﬂora are those species\\nthat live on or in nearly everyone almost all the time.\\nThese residents live in speciﬁc sites, and we provide a\\nvery favorable environment for them. Some, such as\\nStaphylococcus epidermidis, live on the skin. Others, such\\nas E. coli, live in the colon and small intestine. When\\nin their natural sites, resident ﬂora do not cause harm\\nto healthy tissue, and some are even beneﬁcial to us.\\nHowever, residents may become pathogenic if they\\nare introduced into abnormal sites. If E. coli, for exam-\\nple, gains access to the urinary bladder, it causes an\\ninfection called cystitis. In this situation, E. coli is con-\\nsidered an opportunist, which is a normally harmless\\nspecies that has become a pathogen in special circum-\\nstances.\\nTransient ﬂora are those species that are found\\nperiodically on or in the body; they are not as well\\nadapted to us as are the resident ﬂora. Streptococcus\\npneumoniae, for example, is a transient in the upper res-\\npiratory tract, where it usually does not cause harm in\\nhealthy people. However, transients may become path-\\nogenic when the host’s resistance is lowered. In an eld-\\nerly person with inﬂuenza, S. pneumoniae may invade\\nthe lower respiratory tract and cause a serious or even\\nfatal pneumonia.\\nThe distribution of our normal ﬂora is summarized\\nin T able 22–1. Y ou can see that an important function\\nof normal ﬂora is to inhibit the growth of pathogens\\nin the oral cavity, intestines, and in women, the vagina.\\nThe resident bacteria are believed to do this by pro-\\nducing antibacterial chemicals but also by simply\\nbeing there and providing competition that makes it\\ndifficult for pathogens to establish themselves. An\\nexample may be helpful here. Let us use botulism.\\nT ypical food-borne botulism is acquired by ingesting\\nthe bacterial toxin that has been produced in food.\\nInfants, however, may acquire botulism by ingesting\\nthe spores (dormant forms) of the botulism bacteria\\non foods such as honey or raw vegetables. The infant’s\\ncolon ﬂora is not yet abundant, and the botulism\\nspores may be able to germinate into active cells that\\nproduce toxin in the baby’s own intestine. For older\\nchildren or adults, botulism spores are harmless if\\ningested, because the normal colon ﬂora prevents the\\ngrowth of these bacteria.\\nRecent research suggests that some speciﬁc bacte-\\nria in our colon ﬂora are even more important than we\\nthought. One species, Bacteroides fragilis , produces a\\npolysaccharide, Psac, that may be necessary for the\\nnormal development of certain aspects of the human\\nimmune system: production of normal T cells by the\\nthymus gland and the proper functioning of the\\nspleen. We have much more to learn about our rela-\\ntionship with our resident ﬂora.\\nResident ﬂora may be diminished by the use of\\nantibiotics to treat bacterial infections. An antibiotic\\ndoes not distinguish between the pathogen and the\\nresident bacteria. In such circumstances, without the\\nusual competition, yeasts or pathogenic bacteria may\\nbe able to overgrow and create new infections. This is\\nmost likely to occur on mucous membranes such as\\nthose of the oral cavity and vagina.\\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE\\nAn infectious disease is one that is caused by microor-\\nganisms or by the products (toxins) of microorganisms.\\nT o cause an infection, a microorganism must enter and\\nestablish itself in a host and begin reproducing.\\nSeveral factors determine whether a person will\\ndevelop an infection when exposed to a pathogen.\\nThese include the virulence of the pathogen and the\\nresistance of the host. Virulence is the ability of the\\npathogen to cause disease. Host resistance is the total\\nof the body’s defenses against pathogens. Our defenses\\ninclude aspects of innate immunity such as intact skin\\nand mucous membranes, and the sweeping of cilia to\\nclear the respiratory tract, as well as adequate nutri-\\ntion, and the adaptive immune responses of our lym-\\nphocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 14).\\nT o illustrate these concepts, let us compare the\\nmeasles virus and rhinoviruses (common cold). The\\nmeasles virus has at least a 90% infectivity rate, mean-\\ning that for every 100 non-immune people exposed,\\nat least 90 will develop clinical measles. Thus, the\\nmeasles virus is considered highly virulent, even\\nfor healthy people. However, people who have recov-\\nered from measles or who have received the measles\\nvaccine have developed an active immunity that\\nincreases their resistance to measles.

Symptoms are observable or measurable\\nchanges that indicate illness. For some diseases, sub-\\nclinical (inapparent or asymptomatic) infections are\\npossible, in which the person shows no symptoms.\\nWomen with the sexually transmitted disease gonor-\\nrhea, for example, may have subclinical infections, that\\nis, no symptoms at all.

This is called\\nthe incubation period. Most infectious diseases have\\nrather speciﬁc incubation periods (T able 22–2). Some\\ndiseases, however, have more variable incubation peri-\\nods (see hepatitis in T able 22–2), which may make it\\ndifficult to predict the onset of illness after exposure\\nor to trace outbreaks of a disease.\\nA short time called the prodromal period may\\nfollow the incubation period.

An acute infec-\\ntion is one that usually begins abruptly and is severe.\\nIn contrast, a chronic infection often progresses\\nslowly and may last for a long time.\\nA secondary infection is one that is made possible\\nby a primary infection that has lowered the host’s\\nresistance.

In some win-\\nters, however, the number of cases of inﬂuenza\\nincreases, often markedly, and this is an epidemic.\\nA pandemic is an epidemic that has spread\\nthroughout several countries. The bubonic plague\\npandemic of the 14th century affected nearly all of\\nEurope and killed one-fourth of the population. Just\\nafter World War I, from 1918 to 1920, an especially\\nvirulent strain of the inﬂuenza virus spread around the\\nworld and caused at least 20 million deaths. More\\nrecently, an epidemic of cholera began in Peru in\\nJanuary 1991, but soon became a pandemic as cholera\\nspread to neighboring South American countries.\\nT o understand the epidemiology of a disease, we\\nmust know several things about the pathogen. These\\ninclude where it lives in a host, the kinds of hosts it can\\ninfect, and whether it can survive outside of hosts.\\nPORTALS OF ENTRY AND EXIT\\nThe portal of entry is the way the pathogen enters a\\nhost (Fig. 22–1). Breaks in the skin, even very small\\nones, are potential portals of entry, as are the natural\\nbody openings. Pathogens may be inhaled, consumed\\nwith food and water, or acquired during sexual activ-\\nity. Most pathogens that enter the body by way of\\nthese natural routes are destroyed by the white blood\\ncells found in and below the skin and mucous mem-\\nbranes, but some may be able to establish themselves\\nand cause disease. Y ou may wonder if the eye can be a\\nportal of entry for other than eye infections, or you\\nmay already know that it is a portal for many respira-\\ntory viruses. People may pick up cold or ﬂu viruses on\\ntheir hands and then rub their eyes; the viruses are\\nthen washed by tears into the nasal cavities, their pre-\\nferred site of infection.\\nInsects such as mosquitoes, ﬂeas, and lice, and other\\narthropods, such as ticks, are vectors of disease. They\\nspread pathogens when they bite to obtain a host’s\\nblood. Mosquitoes, for example, are vectors of malaria,\\nyellow fever, and encephalitis. Ticks are vectors of\\nLyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\\nAs mentioned previously, it is important to keep in\\nmind that many hospital procedures may provide por-\\ntals of entry for pathogens.

Thus\\nit is essential that all healthcare workers follow aseptic\\ntechnique for such procedures.\\nThe portal of exit (see Fig. 22–1) is the way\\nthe pathogen leaves the body or is shed from the\\nhost. Skin lesions, such as those of chickenpox, con-\\ntain pathogens that may be transmitted to others by\\ncutaneous contact. Intestinal pathogens such as the\\nhepatitis A virus and the cholera bacteria are excreted\\nin the host’s feces, which may contaminate food\\nor water and be ingested by another host (this is called\\nthe fecal–oral route of transmission). Respiratory\\npathogens such as inﬂuenza and measles viruses\\nare shed in respiratory droplets from the mouth and\\nnose and may be inhaled by another person. The\\npathogens of the reproductive tract, such as the bacte-\\nria that cause syphilis and gonorrhea, are transmitted\\nto others by sexual contact. Notice that with respect to\\nepidemiology, the pathogen travels from one host’s\\nportal of exit to another host’s portal of entry.\\nRESERVOIRS OF INFECTION\\nSome pathogens cause disease only in people. Measles,\\nwhooping cough, syphilis, and bacterial meningitis are\\nstrictly human diseases. T o acquire such a disease, a\\nperson must be exposed to someone who has the\\nillness.\\nAlso of importance is that upon recovery from\\nsome diseases, the host may continue to harbor the\\npathogen and thus be a reservoir of it for others. Such\\na person is called a carrier. Diseases for which the car-\\nrier state is possible include typhoid, diphtheria, and\\nhepatitis B.\\nMany other diseases, however, are really animal\\ndiseases that people acquire in certain circumstances.\\nThese diseases are called zoonoses (singular: zoono-\\nsis) and include plague, Lyme disease, encephalitis,\\nand Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which are spread\\nfrom animal to person by vectors such as ticks or ﬂeas.\\nRabies is acquired by contact with infected animal\\nsaliva or infected tissue, the virus entering the new\\nhost through breaks in the skin. Salmonellosis is a type\\nof food poisoning caused by the intestinal bacilli of\\nanimals that contaminate meats such as chicken and\\nturkey. Prevention of such diseases depends upon\\nknowledge of how they are spread. For example, peo-\\nple who live in areas where Lyme disease is endemic\\nshould be aware that the disease is acquired by way of\\na tick bite. If children and pets are examined for ticks\\nafter they have been out of doors, the chance of\\nacquiring Lyme disease is greatly diminished.\\nSome bacteria are pathogenic only by accident, for\\ntheir natural habitat is soil or water, where they act as\\ndecomposers. The bacteria that cause gas gangrene,\\ntetanus, and botulism are normal soil ﬂora and cause\\ndisease when they (or their toxins) contaminate a skin\\nwound, or, in the case of botulism, the toxin is present\\nin food.\\nSPREAD OF INFECTION\\nBased on our knowledge thus far, we can classify infec-\\ntious diseases as noncommunicable or communicable.\\nA noncommunicable disease is one in which a resi-\\ndent species causes disease under certain conditions or\\nin which a non-resident species causes disease when it\\nenters the body. Such diseases cannot be transmitted\\ndirectly or indirectly from host to host. Cystitis caused\\nby E. coli in a hospital patient, for example, is not com-\\nmunicable to the nurses who care for that patient.\\nSimilarly, a nurse caring for a patient with tetanus or\\nbotulism need not worry about acquiring these dis-\\neases; both are noncommunicable.\\nA communicable disease is one in which the\\npathogen may be transmitted directly or indirectly\\nfrom host to host. Direct spread of infection is by way\\nof cutaneous contact (including sexual contact), respi-\\nratory droplets, contaminated blood, or placental\\ntransmission from mother to fetus. Indirect spread\\nis by way of contaminated food or water, or vectors,\\nor fomites, which are inanimate objects that carry\\nthe pathogen. Inﬂuenza and cold viruses, for example,\\ncan survive outside their hosts for a time, so that\\nobjects such as eating utensils, door knobs, or chil-\\ndren’s toys may be vehicles of transmission for these\\npathogens.\\nSome communicable diseases may also be called\\ncontagious, which means that they are easily spread\\nfrom person to person by casual cutaneous contact or\\nby respiratory droplets. Chickenpox, measles, and\\ninﬂuenza are contagious diseases. In contrast, AIDS is\\nnot contagious, because sexual contact, blood contact,\\nor placental transmission is necessary to acquire the\\nvirus (HIV). HIV is not spread by cutaneous contact\\nor by respiratory droplets.\\nMETHODS OF CONTROL\\nOF MICROBES\\nMicroorganisms are everywhere in our environment,\\nand although we need not always be aware of their\\npresence, there are times when we must try to dimin-\\n504 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 504'),\n",

These situations include\\nthe use of chemicals for disinfection, especially in\\nhospitals, and the protection of our food and water\\nsupplies.\\nANTISEPTICS, DISINFECTANTS,\\nAND STERILIZATION\\nWe are all familiar with the practice of applying iodine,\\nhydrogen peroxide, or alcohol to minor cuts in the\\nskin, and we know the purpose of this: to prevent bac-\\nterial infection. The use of such chemicals does indeed\\ndestroy many harmful bacteria, although it has no\\neffect on bacterial spores. The chemicals used to pre-\\nvent infection may be called antiseptics or disinfec-\\ntants. An antiseptic (anti /H11005against; septic /H11005infection)\\nis a chemical that destroys bacteria or inhibits their\\ngrowth on a living being. The chemicals named above\\nare antiseptics on skin surfaces. A disinfectant is a\\nchemical that is used on inanimate objects. Chemicals\\nwith antibacterial effects may be further classiﬁed as\\nbactericidal or bacteriostatic. Bactericides kill bacteria\\nby disrupting important metabolic processes.\\nBacteriostatic chemicals do not destroy bacteria, but\\nrather inhibit their reproduction and slow their\\ngrowth. Alcohol, for example, is a bactericide that is\\nboth an antiseptic and a disinfectant, depending upon\\nthe particular surface on which it is used.\\nSome chemicals are not suitable for use on human\\nskin because they are irritating or damaging, but they\\nmay be used on environmental surfaces as disinfec-\\ntants. Bleach, such as Clorox, and cresols, such as\\nLysol, may be used in bathrooms, on ﬂoors or coun-\\ntertops, and even on dishes and eating utensils (if\\nrinsed thoroughly). These bactericides will also des-\\ntroy certain viruses, such as those that cause inﬂuenza.\\nA dilute (10%) bleach solution will inactivate HIV , the\\nvirus that causes AIDS.\\nIn hospitals, environmental surfaces are disinfected,\\nbut materials such as surgical instruments, sutures,\\nand dressings must be sterilized. Sterilization is a\\nprocess that destroys all living organisms. Most med-\\nical and laboratory products are sterilized by autoclav-\\ning. An autoclave is a chamber in which steam is\\ngenerated under pressure. This pressurized steam\\npenetrates the contents of the chamber and kills all\\nmicroorganisms present, including bacterial spores.\\nMaterials such as disposable plastics that might be\\ndamaged by autoclaving are often sterilized by expo-\\nsure to ionizing radiation. Foods such as meats may\\nalso be sterilized by this method. Such food products\\nhave a very long shelf life (equivalent to canned food),\\nand this procedure is used for preparing some military\\nﬁeld rations.\\nPUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES\\nEach of us is rightfully concerned with our own health\\nand the health of our families. People who work in the\\npublic health professions, however, consider the\\nhealth of all of us, that is, the health of a population.\\nT wo traditional aspects of public health are ensuring\\nsafe food and safe drinking water. T wo more recent\\naspects are tracking and learning about emerging dis-\\neases, and preparing defenses against the possible use\\nof biological weapons.\\nFood\\nThe safety of our food depends on a number of\\nfactors. Most cities have certain standards and prac-\\ntices that must be followed by supermarkets and\\nrestaurants, and inspections are conducted on a regu-\\nlar basis.\\nFood companies prepare their products by using\\nspeciﬁc methods to prevent the growth of microor-\\nganisms. Naturally, it is in the best interests of these\\ncompanies to do so, for they would soon be out of\\nbusiness if their products made people ill. Also of\\nimportance is the willingness of companies to recall\\nproducts that are only suspected of being contami-\\nnated. This is all to the beneﬁt of consumers. For\\nexample, since 1925 in the United States, only ﬁve\\nfatal cases of botulism have been traced to commer-\\ncially canned food. If we consider that billions of cans\\nof food have been consumed during this time, we can\\nappreciate the high standards the food industry has\\nmaintained.\\nMilk and milk products provide ideal environments\\nfor the growth of bacteria because they contain both\\nprotein and sugar (lactose) as food sources. For this\\nreason, milk must be pasteurized, that is, heated to\\n145/H11034F (62.9 /H11034C) for 30 minutes. Newer methods of\\npasteurization use higher temperatures for shorter\\nperiods of time, but the result is the same: The\\npathogens that may be present in milk are killed,\\nalthough not all bacteria are totally destroyed. Milk\\nproducts such as cheese and ice cream are also pas-\\nteurized, or are made from pasteurized milk.\\nWhen a food-related outbreak of disease does take\\nplace, public health workers try to trace the outbreak\\nto its source. This stops the immediate spread of dis-\\nease by preventing access to the contaminated food,\\nand the ensuing publicity on television or in the news-\\nAn Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 505\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 505'),\n",

Meat should\\nbe thoroughly cooked. Fruit and vegetables should be\\nwashed or peeled before being eaten raw. (Food-borne\\ndiseases, also called food poisoning, are included in\\nthe tables of diseases that appear at the end of this\\nchapter.)\\nFinally, the safety of our food may depend on some-\\nthing we often take for granted: our refrigerators. For\\nexample, a Thanksgiving turkey that was carved for\\ndinner at 3 \\nP.M. and left on the kitchen counter until\\nmidnight probably should not be used for turkey sand-\\nwiches the next day. Although we have to rely on oth-\\ners to ensure that commercially prepared food will be\\nsafe, once food reaches our homes, all we really need\\n(besides the refrigerator) is our common sense.\\nWater\\nWhen we turn on a faucet to get a glass of water, we\\nusually do not wonder whether the water is safe to\\ndrink. It usually is. Having a reliable supply of clean\\ndrinking water depends on two things: diverting\\nhuman sewage away from water supplies and chlori-\\nnating water intended for human consumption.\\nLarge cities have sewer systems for the collection of\\nwastewater and its subsequent treatment in sewage\\nplants. Once treated, however, the sludge (solid, par-\\nticulate matter) from these plants must be disposed of.\\nThis is becoming more of a problem simply because\\nthere is so much sewage sludge (because there are so\\nmany of us). Although the sludge is largely free of\\npathogens, it ought not to be put in landﬁlls, and\\nbecause ocean dumping is being prohibited in many\\ncoastal areas, this is a problem that will be with us for\\na long time.\\nDrinking water for cities and towns is usually chlo-\\nrinated. The added chlorine kills virtually all bacteria\\nthat may be present. The importance of chlorination\\nis shown by a 1978 outbreak of enteritis (diarrhea)\\nin a Vermont town of 10,000 people. The chlorina-\\ntion process malfunctioned for 2 days, and 2000 of the\\ntown’s inhabitants became ill. (The bacterium\\nwas Campylobacter, a common intestinal inhabitant of\\nanimals.)\\nY ou may now be wondering if all those bottled\\nspring waters are safe to drink. The answer, in general,\\nis yes, because the bottling companies do not wish to\\nmake people ill and put themselves out of business.\\nSome bottled waters, however, do have higher mold\\nspore counts than does chlorinated tap water. Usually\\nthese molds are not harmful when ingested; they are\\ndestroyed by the hydrochloric acid in gastric juice.\\nIn much of North America, nearly everyone has\\neasy access to safe drinking water. We might remind\\nourselves once in a while that our water will not give\\nus typhoid, dysentery, or cholera. These diseases are\\nstill very common in other parts of the world, where\\nthe nearest river or stream is the laundry, the sewer,\\nand the source of drinking water. The World Health\\nOrganization (WHO) estimates that more than 2.5\\nbillion people do not have basic sanitation, and more\\nthan 1 billion do not have dependable access to clean\\nwater to drink.\\nEmerging Diseases\\nand Biological Weapons\\nThe term emerging diseases may be a bit misleading,\\nbecause some of the pathogens are not really new.\\nWhat has happened is that we have become aware of\\nthem. A good example of this is Lyme disease. Lyme\\ndisease in the United States was named for the town in\\nConnecticut where a cluster of cases was discovered in\\nthe 1970s. When the causative bacteria were later\\nfound and the disease fully characterized, health offi-\\ncials realized that the disease had been described in\\nScandinavia in the early years of the 20th century.\\nLyme disease was not a new disease after all, merely a\\nnewly encountered disease for Americans.\\nOther emerging diseases are those caused by the\\nEbola and Marburg viruses, by Hantavirus, West Nile\\nvirus, and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syn-\\ndrome) virus, by certain strains of E. coli, and by antibi-\\notic-resistant strains of enterococci. The tasks of public\\nhealth officials are to keep track of all cases of these\\ndiseases and to educate medical personnel about them.\\nAnthrax is no longer in the news, as it was in the\\nautumn of 2001 when spores were sent through the\\nU.S. mail. As of 2006, no other instances of the use of\\nbiological weapons have been reported, though use of\\nthe smallpox virus as a weapon remains a concern.\\nPublic health officials had hoped that improvements\\nto public health policies and procedures that were\\nspurred by the use of anthrax as a weapon would not\\n506 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 506'),\n",

Unfortunately, that has not proven\\ntrue, because as of 2006 most nations were not at all\\nprepared for a possible pandemic of avian ﬂu.\\nAvian inﬂuenza A (H5N1) is truly an emerging dis-\\nease. The virus is a natural parasite of wild birds\\nand has infected domestic ﬂocks in Asia, Europe, and\\nAfrica. Although not a frequent event, people have\\ncaught the virus from infected chickens or ducks,\\nand the human mortality rate has been 50% (though\\nwith a relatively small number of cases, fewer than 500,\\nthis may not be accurate). The great concern is that\\nthe virus will mutate and become contagious for peo-\\nple, that is, easily transmissible from person to person.\\nBy way of plane travel, the virus could be spread\\nthroughout the world in a matter of weeks. The avian\\nﬂu virus H5N1 may never mutate into a “people”\\nvirus, but we have to be prepared for just that. As of\\n2006 we have no vaccine for this virus (some are in the\\ntesting stages) and only one antiviral medication that is\\neven somewhat effective. Because this would be a\\n“new” disease for people, it is possible that no group of\\npeople will have evolved any kind of resistance to it.\\nBird ﬂu may be for us what measles was to the\\nHawaiian islanders in the 18th and 19th centuries. The\\nmeasles virus was brought to the islands by Europeans\\n(for whom it was usually not fatal, reﬂecting thousands\\nof years of coexistence) and nearly wiped out the native\\npopulation, for whom it was a new virus.\\nHowever, this is by no means certain. It may be that\\nmilder cases of human avian ﬂu have been overlooked\\nthus far, that H5N1 causes a wide spectrum of disease\\nin people, from mild to fatal.

All are\\nmicroscopic in size, and a magniﬁcation of 1000 times\\nis usually necessary to see them clearly. A bacterial cell\\nconsists of watery cytoplasm and a single chromosome\\n(made of DNA) surrounded by a cell membrane.\\nEnclosing all of these structures is a cell wall, which is\\nstrong and often rigid, giving the bacterium its char-\\nacteristic shape.\\nBased on shape, bacteria are classiﬁed as one of\\nthree groups: coccus, bacillus, or spirillum (Fig. 22–2).\\nA coccus (plural: cocci) is a sphere; under the micro-\\nscope, cocci appear round. Certain preﬁxes may be\\nused to describe the arrangement of spheres. Staphylo\\nmeans clusters, strepto refers to chains of cells, and\\ndiplo means pairs of cells.\\nA bacillus (plural: bacilli) is a rod-shaped bac-\\nterium; rods may vary in length depending on the\\ngenus. A spirillum (plural: spirilla) is a long cell with\\none or more curves or coils. Some spirilla, such as\\nthose that cause syphilis and Lyme disease, are called\\nspirochetes. Many of the bacilli and spirilla are capa-\\nble of movement because they have ﬂagella. These\\nare long, thread-like structures that project from the\\ncell and beat rhythmically.\\nBacteria reproduce by the process of binary ﬁs-\\nsion, in which the chromosome duplicates itself, and\\nthe original cell divides into two identical cells. The\\npresence or absence of oxygen may be important for\\nbacterial reproduction. Aerobic bacteria can repro-\\nduce only in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic\\nbacteria can reproduce only in the absence of oxygen.\\nFacultatively anaerobic bacteria are not inhibited in\\neither situation; they are able to reproduce in either\\nthe presence or absence of oxygen. This is obviously\\nan advantage for the bacteria, and many pathogens\\nand potential pathogens are facultative anaerobes.\\nThe Gram Stain\\nBased on the chemicals in their cell walls, most bacte-\\nria can be put into one of two groups, called gram\\npositive or gram negative. A simple laboratory pro-\\ncedure called the Gram stain (see Fig. 22–2) shows us\\nthe shape of the bacteria and their gram reactions.\\nGram-positive bacteria appear purple or blue, and\\ngram-negative bacteria appear pink or red. Some bac-\\nteria do not stain with the Gram method (many spir-\\nilla and spirochetes do not), but for those that do, each\\ngenus is either gram positive or gram negative. This\\ndoes not change, just as the characteristic shape of the\\nbacteria does not change. The genus Streptococcus, for\\nexample, is always a gram-positive coccus; the genus\\nEscherichia is always a gram-negative bacillus. If a\\nGram stain is done on a sputum specimen from a\\npatient with pneumonia, and a gram-positive coccus is\\nfound, this eliminates all of the gram-negative cocci\\nand bacilli that may also cause pneumonia. The Gram\\nstain, therefore, is often an important ﬁrst step in the\\nidentiﬁcation of the pathogen that is causing a partic-\\nular infection. In T able 22–3 (at the end of this chap-\\nter), the gram reaction (where applicable) and shape\\nare included for each pathogen.\\nSpecial Characteristics\\nAlthough bacteria are simple cells, many have special\\nstructural or functional characteristics that help them\\nto survive. Some bacilli and cocci have capsules (see\\nFig. 22–2); a capsule is a gelatinous sheath that enclo-\\nses the entire cell. Capsules are beneﬁcial to the bac-\\nteria because they inhibit phagocytosis by the host’s\\nwhite blood cells. This gives the bacteria time to\\nreproduce and possibly establish themselves in the\\nhost. This is not beneﬁcial from our point of view\\n(remember that we are the hosts), but bacterial cap-\\nsules are also antigenic, which means that they stim-\\nulate antibody production by our lymphocytes. This\\nstarts the destruction of bacteria by our immune\\nresponses. We take advantage of this by using bacter-\\nial capsules in some of our vaccines, such as those used\\nto prevent pneumonia and meningitis.\\nSome bacilli are able to survive unfavorable envi-\\nronments by forming spores. A spore is a dormant\\n(inactive) stage that consists of the chromosome and a\\nsmall amount of cytoplasm surrounded by a thick wall.\\nSpores can survive conditions such as heat (even boil-\\ning), freezing, or dehydration, which would kill the\\nvegetative (active) forms of the bacterial cells.\\nFortunately for us, most pathogens are unable to form\\nspores, but some that do are the causative agents of gas\\ngangrene, botulism, tetanus, and anthrax. These bac-\\nteria are decomposers in the soil environment, and\\ntheir spore-forming ability enables them to survive the\\nextremes of temperature and lack of water that may\\noccur in the soil.\\nMany bacteria cause disease because they produce\\ntoxins, which are chemicals that are harmful to host\\ntissues. Often these toxins are the equivalent of our\\n508 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 508'),\n",

In the United States, the most\\ncommon rickettsial disease is Rocky Mountain spotted\\nfever, which is spread by ticks. In other parts of the\\nworld, epidemic typhus, which is spread by body lice,\\nis still an important disease. From a historical per-\\nspective, until World War I, more people died of epi-\\ndemic typhus during times of war than were killed by\\nweapons.\\nThe chlamydias (also: chlamydiae) cause several\\nhuman diseases, including ornithosis (parrot fever)\\nand trachoma, which is the leading cause of blindness\\nthroughout the world. In the United States, chlamy-\\ndial infection of the genitourinary tract has become\\none of the most prevalent sexually transmitted dis-\\neases, with estimates of 4 million new cases each year.\\nBoth rickettsial and chlamydial infections can be\\ntreated with antibiotics.\\nAntibiotics\\nAntibiotics are chemicals that are used to treat bacter-\\nial infections. A broad-spectrum antibiotic is one that\\naffects many different kinds of bacteria; a narrow-\\nspectrum antibiotic affects just a few kinds of bacteria.\\nThe use of antibiotics is based on a very simple\\nprinciple: Certain chemicals can disrupt or inhibit the\\nchemical reactions that bacteria must carry out to sur-\\nvive. An antibiotic such as penicillin blocks the forma-\\ntion of bacterial cell walls; without their cell walls,\\nbacteria will die. Other antibiotics inhibit DNA syn-\\nthesis or protein synthesis. These are vital activities\\nfor the bacteria, and without them bacteria cannot\\nreproduce and will die.\\nIt is very important to remember that our own cells\\ncarry out chemical reactions that are very similar to\\nsome of those found in bacteria. For this reason, our\\nown cells may be damaged by antibiotics. This is why\\nsome antibiotics have harmful side effects. The most\\nserious side effects are liver and kidney damage or\\ndepression of the red bone marrow. The liver is\\nresponsible for detoxifying the medication, which may\\naccumulate and damage liver cells. Similar damage\\nmay occur in the kidneys, which are responsible for\\nexcreting the medication. The red bone marrow is a\\nvery active tissue, with constant mitosis and protein\\nsynthesis to produce RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Any\\nantibiotic that interferes with these processes may\\ndecrease production of all of these blood cells.\\nPatients who are receiving any of the potentially toxic\\nantibiotics should be monitored with periodic tests of\\nliver and kidney function or with blood counts to\\nassess the state of the red bone marrow.\\nAnother problem with the use of antibiotics is that\\nbacteria may become resistant to them, and so be\\nunaffected. Bacterial resistance means that the bacte-\\nria are able to produce an enzyme that destroys the\\nantibiotic, rendering it useless. This is a genetic capa-\\nbility on the part of bacteria, and it is, therefore,\\npassed to new generations of bacterial cells.\\nLet us use an example with small numbers and say\\nthat, of 1000 bacterial cells, 998 are killed by a certain\\nantibiotic. The remaining two bacteria have the gene\\nfor an enzyme that breaks the antibiotic molecule, so\\nthey survive. What will these two bacteria do? Each\\nwill divide by binary ﬁssion, becoming two cells, four\\ncells, eight cells, and so on. At the end of 20 divisions\\n(which under optimum conditions may take less than\\n24 hours) each bacterium has become more than a\\nmillion bacteria. And what is true of all of these bacte-\\nria? They all have the gene for resistance to that par-\\nticular antibiotic.\\nThis is exactly what has happened with Staphylo-\\ncoccus aureus , most strains of which are resistant to\\npenicillin, and some strains of which are resistant\\nto many other antibiotics as well. Most of the gram-\\nnegative intestinal bacilli are resistant to a great vari-\\nety of antibiotics. This is why culture and sensitivity\\ntesting is so important before an antibiotic is chosen\\nto treat these infections.\\nEducation is also important, and healthcare person-\\nnel must help educate the general public not to\\ndemand antibiotics for colds or the ﬂu. These are viral\\ndiseases for which antibiotics are useless. What hap-\\npens is that the antibiotic kills all susceptible bacteria\\n(even beneﬁcial ones) and leaves resistant bacteria to\\nbecome the most numerous, perhaps to cause serious\\ndisease in the future.\\nT o counteract bacterial resistance, new antibiotics\\nare produced that are not inactivated by the destruc-\\ntive bacterial enzymes. Within a few years, however,\\nthe usefulness of these new antibiotics will probably\\ndiminish as bacteria mutate and develop resistance.\\nThis is not a battle that we can ever truly win, because\\nbacteria are living organisms that evolve as their envi-\\nronment changes. We must never underestimate the\\nability of bacteria to evolve ways to neutralize the\\nantibiotics we use to kill them. The development of\\nnew antibiotics is crucial if we are to stay a step ahead\\nof these remarkably adaptable microorganisms.\\nAntibiotics have changed our lives, although\\n510 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 510'),\n",

A child’s strep throat\\nwill probably not progress to meningitis, and bacterial\\npneumonia does not have the very high fatality rate\\nthat it once did. But, we must keep in mind that antibi-\\notics are not a “cure” for any disease. An infection,\\nespecially a serious one, means that the immune sys-\\ntem has been overwhelmed by the pathogen. An\\nantibiotic diminishes the number of bacteria to a level\\nwith which the immune system can cope. Ultimately,\\nhowever, the body’s own white blood cells must elim-\\ninate the very last of the bacteria.\\nVIRUSES (SEE TABLE 22–4)\\nViruses are not cells; their structure is even simpler\\nthan that of bacteria, which are the simplest cells. A\\nvirus consists of either DNA or RNA surrounded by a\\nprotein shell. The protein shell has a shape that is\\ncharacteristic for each virus (Fig. 22–3). There are no\\nenzymes, cytoplasm, cell membranes, or cell walls in\\nviruses, and they can reproduce only when inside the\\nliving cells of a host. Therefore, all viruses are obligate\\nintracellular parasites, and they cause disease when\\nthey reproduce inside cells. When a virus enters a host\\ncell, it uses the cell’s chromosomes, RNA, and enzymes\\nto make new viruses. Several hundred new viruses may\\nbe produced from just one virus. The host cell rup-\\ntures and dies, releasing the new viruses, which then\\nenter other cells and reproduce.\\nThe severity of a viral disease depends upon the\\ntypes of cells infected. If the virus affects skin cells, for\\nexample, the disease is usually mild and self-limiting,\\nsuch as chickenpox. Small numbers of skin cells are\\nnot crucial to our survival, and these cells can be\\nreplaced by mitosis. If, however, the virus affects nerve\\ncells, the disease is more serious and may be fatal.\\nRabies is such as disease. Neurons are much more vital\\nto us, and they cannot be replaced once they die.\\nSome viruses, such as those that cause German\\nmeasles (rubella) and chickenpox, are able to cross the\\nplacenta, that is, pass from maternal circulation to\\nfetal circulation. Although the disease may be very\\nmild for the pregnant woman, the virus may severely\\ndamage developing fetal organs and cause congenital\\nbirth defects such as blindness, heart malformations,\\nand mental retardation. In the most serious cases, fetal\\ninfection may result in miscarriage or stillbirth.\\nSome viruses cause an initial infection, become\\ndormant, then are reactivated, causing another infec-\\ntion months or years later. The herpes viruses that\\ncause cold sores “hide out” in nerves of the face fol-\\nlowing the initial skin lesion. At some later time when\\nthe host’s resistance is lowered, the viruses emerge\\nfrom the nerves and cause another cold sore. The\\nchickenpox virus, which most of us acquire as chil-\\ndren, is a herpes virus that may become dormant in\\nnerves for years, and then be reactivated and cause\\nshingles when we are adults.\\nA few human viruses are known to be tumor\\nviruses, that is, they cause cells to develop abnormally\\nand form tumors. The Epstein-Barr virus, which\\ncauses mononucleosis in North America, is associated\\nwith Burkitt’s lymphoma in Africa and with nasopha-\\nryngeal carcinoma in China. There are environmental\\nfactors, as yet unknown, that contribute to the devel-\\nopment of these cancers in speciﬁc parts of the world.\\nAn Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 511\\nFigure 22–3.

First, viruses are active\\n(reproducing) only within cells, so the medication\\nmust be able to enter infected cells to be effective.\\nSecond, viruses are such simple structures that the\\nchoice of which of their chemical processes to attempt\\nto disrupt is limited. Third, viruses use the host cell’s\\nDNA and enzymes for self-replication, and a medica-\\ntion that interferes with DNA or enzymes may kill the\\nhost cell even as it kills the virus.\\nThese problems are illustrated by zidovudine\\n(AZT), the ﬁrst medication that was effective against\\nHIV , the virus that causes AIDS. Zidovudine works by\\ninterfering with DNA synthesis, which the virus must\\ncarry out to reproduce. The side effects of zidovudine,\\nwhich are experienced by a signiﬁcant number of\\nAIDS patients, are caused by the disruption of DNA\\nsynthesis in the person’s own cells.\\nDespite these obstacles, successful antiviral drugs\\nhave been developed. Acyclovir, for example, has\\nproved to be useful in the control (not cure) of herpes\\nviruses. Ribavirin has been quite effective in the treat-\\nment of respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in\\ninfants and young children. This is an area of intensive\\nresearch, and more antiviral medications will\\nundoubtedly be found within the next decade.\\nWe must be aware, however, that many viruses\\nundergo mutations with great frequency. Inﬂuenza\\nviruses do (this is the reason we need a new ﬂu vaccine\\nevery year), and it was perhaps inevitable that ﬂu virus\\nmutations would provide them with resistance to\\nantiviral medications. In January 2006 the CDC\\nadvised physicians not to prescribe amantadine and\\nrimantadine for patients with inﬂuenza, because more\\nthan 90% of the strains of inﬂuenza A virus had devel-\\noped resistance to both drugs. Staying one step ahead\\nof such viruses may prove to be difficult.\\nFUNGI (SEE TABLE 22–5)\\nFungi may be unicellular, such as yeasts, or multicel-\\nlular, such as the familiar molds and mushrooms. Most\\nfungi are saprophytes (also called saprobes); that is,\\nthey live on dead organic matter and decompose it to\\nrecycle the chemicals as nutrients. The pathogenic\\nfungi cause infections that are called mycoses (singu-\\nlar: mycosis), which may be superﬁcial or systemic.\\nY easts (Fig. 22–4) have been used by people for\\nthousands of years in baking and brewing. In small\\nnumbers, yeasts such as Candida albicans are part of the\\nresident ﬂora of the skin, mouth, intestines, and\\nvagina. In larger numbers, however, yeasts may cause\\nsuperﬁcial infections of mucous membranes or the\\nskin, or very serious systemic infections of internal\\norgans. An all-too-common trigger for oral or vaginal\\nyeast infections is the use of an antibiotic to treat a\\nbacterial infection. The antibiotic diminishes the nor-\\nmal bacterial ﬂora, thereby removing competition for\\nthe yeasts, which are then able to overgrow. Y easts may\\nalso cause skin infections in diabetics, or in obese peo-\\nple who have skin folds that are always moist. In recent\\nyears, Candida has become an important cause of noso-\\ncomial infections. The resistance of hospital patients is\\noften lowered because of their diseases or treatments,\\nand they are more susceptible to systemic yeast infec-\\ntions in the form of pneumonia or endocarditis.\\nAnother superﬁcial mycosis is ringworm (tinea),\\nwhich may be caused by several species of fungi (see\\nT able 22–5 at the end of this chapter). The name\\nringworm is misleading, because there are no worms\\ninvolved. It is believed to have come from the appear-\\nance of the lesions: circular, scaly patches with red\\ndened edges; the center clears as the lesion grows.\\nAthlete’s foot, which is probably a bacterial-fungal\\ninfection, is perhaps the most common form of ring-\\nworm.\\nThe systemic mycoses are more serious diseases\\nthat occur when spores of some fungi gain access to\\nthe interior of the body. Most of these fungi grow in a\\nmold-like pattern. The molds we sometimes see on\\nstale bread or overripe fruit look ﬂuffy or fuzzy. The\\nﬂuff is called a mycelium and is made of many thread-\\nlike cellular structures called hyphae. The color of a\\nmold is due to the spore cases (sporangia) in which the\\nreproductive spores are produced (see Fig. 22–4).\\nEach spore may be carried by the air to another site,\\nwhere it germinates and forms another mycelium.\\nBecause spores of these fungi are common in the\\nenvironment, they are often inhaled. The immune\\nresponses are usually able to prevent infection and\\nhealthy people are usually not susceptible to systemic\\nmycoses. Elderly people and those with chronic pul-\\nmonary diseases are much more susceptible, however,\\nand they may develop lung infections.

Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P.\\ncarinii and classiﬁed with the protozoa, its DNA\\nsequences suggest it is closer to the fungi) is an impor-\\ntant cause of pneumonia in people with AIDS. This\\nspecies is usually not pathogenic, because the healthy\\nimmune system can easily control it. For AIDS\\npatients, however, this form of pneumonia is often the\\ncause of death.\\nAntifungal Medications\\nOne of the most effective drugs used to treat serious,\\nsystemic mycoses, amphotericin B, has great potential\\nto cause serious side effects. Patients receiving this\\nmedication should have periodic tests of liver and kid-\\nney function.

When\\nthese cells die and reach the stratum corneum, they are\\nresistant to the digestive action of the ringworm fungi.\\nAn effective topical spray has also been developed.\\nThere are several effective medications for mucosal\\nyeast infections, but it is important that the trigger for\\nthe infection (such as antibiotic therapy) be resolved as\\nwell. If it is not, the yeast infection may recur when\\nthe medication is stopped.\\nPROTOZOA (SEE TABLE 22–6)\\nProtozoa are unicellular animals, single cells that are\\nadapted to life in freshwater (including soil) and salt-\\nwater.

The\\nparasitic worms are even simpler than the familiar\\nearthworm, because they live within hosts and use the\\nhost’s blood or nutrients as food. Many of the parasitic\\nworms have complex life cycles that involve two or\\nmore different host species.\\nThe ﬂukes are ﬂatworms that are rare in most of\\nNorth America but very common in parts of Africa\\nand Asia. People acquire these species by eating\\naquatic plants or raw ﬁsh in which the larval worms\\nhave encysted. Within the person, each species lives in\\na speciﬁc site: the intestine, bile ducts, or even certain\\nveins. Although rarely fatal, these chronic worm infes-\\ntations are often debilitating, and the host person is a\\nsource of the eggs of the ﬂuke, which may then infect\\nothers.\\nT apeworms are also ﬂatworms (Fig. 22–6).

The segments, called proglottids, are\\nproduced continuously in most species and absorb\\nnutrients from the host’s digested food. The only\\nfunction of the proglottids is reproduction: Eggs in\\none segment are fertilized by sperm from another\\nsegment. Mature proglottids containing fertilized\\neggs break off and are excreted in the host’s feces. An\\nintermediate host such as a cow or pig eats food con-\\ntaminated with human feces, and the eggs hatch\\nwithin this animal and grow into larval worms that\\nencyst in the animal’s muscle tissue.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) involves antibi-\\notics.\\nOtitis media and upper respiratory infection in children; pneumonia in adults, especially\\nthe immunocompromised or elderly. No vaccine.\\nAnthrax: spores in soil may be acquired by cattle or sheep. People acquire disease from\\nthese animals or from animal products such as wool or leather. The three forms are\\npulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal, reﬂecting the portal of entry. The toxin\\ncauses death of tissue, and the pulmonary form may be fatal. Rare in the U.S.,\\nbecause grazing animals are vaccinated. The vaccine for people was reserved for the\\nmilitary, but has been offered to people thought to be exposed to spores. Anthrax is\\na potential biological weapon.\\nGas gangrene: normal soil ﬂora may contaminate wounds; spores require anaerobic\\nenvironment (dead tissue); toxins destroy more tissue, permitting the bacteria to\\nspread; gas produced collects as bubbles in dead tissue. Food poisoning: from con-\\ntaminated meat, self-limiting diarrhea. Some species have contaminated human tis-\\nsue (ligament, tendon) used for transplants.

No vaccine.\\nWhooping cough (pertussis): paroxysms of violent coughing that may last for several\\nweeks. Adults may have less severe coughing and go undiagnosed. Pneumonia is a\\ncomplication that may be fatal, especially for children less than 1 year of age. People\\nare the only host. Concern about the safety of the original vaccine has prompted the\\ndevelopment of newer vaccines, but in the U.S. the number of cases has increased\\nsharply, in part because of parental complacency.\\nCholera: profuse watery diarrhea; infection ranges from mild to fatal. Spread of infection\\nis usually by way of water contaminated with human feces. Rare in the U.S.; epi-\\ndemic in Asia, Africa, and South America. A new oral vaccine seems very effective.\\nEnteritis: diarrhea and nausea.

The spores\\nmay be inhaled or ingested and establish themselves in tissues, leading to systemic\\ninfection characterized by clotting and necrosis. Also causes digestive disease in cattle\\nand pigs.\\nA common mold found on fruits, harmless to healthy people. In those who are immuno-\\ncompromised it may cause sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, or more invasive disease.\\nPneumonia: only in very debilitated or immunosuppressed persons, such as people with\\nAIDS. Although its antibiotic susceptibility is that of a protozoan, its DNA sequences\\nare more similar to those of fungi. Many people become infected during childhood,\\nbut a normal immune system prevents any damage. Such a latent infection may\\nbecome symptomatic and very serious when cell-mediated immunity is impaired.\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 522'),\n",

Spread by the fecal–oral route in water or food.\\nAmebic meningoencephalitis: inﬂammation of the meninges and brain; uncommon in the\\nU.S. but almost always fatal. Amoebas in fresh water are acquired when swimmers sniff\\nwater into the nasal cavities; the amoebas move along the olfactory nerves into the brain.\\nBalantidiasis: abdominal discomfort and diarrhea; often mild. Reservoirs are pigs and other\\ndomestic animals; spread by the fecal–oral route.\\nGiardiasis: fatty diarrhea; may be mild. Reservoirs are wild and domestic animals and people.\\nSpread by the fecal–oral route in water or food prepared by people with mild cases. An\\nimportant cause of diarrhea in daycare centers.\\nTrichomoniasis: a sexually transmitted disease. Women: causes cervicitis and vaginitis; men are\\noften asymptomatic.\\nAfrican sleeping sickness: lethargy progressing to coma and death. Reservoirs are wild and\\ndomestic animals; vector is the tsetse ﬂy. No vaccine.\\nMalaria: the protozoa reproduce in red blood cells, causing hemolysis and anemia. The vector\\nis the Anopheles mosquito. Cerebral malaria is the most severe form, and it is often fatal for\\nchildren. The WHO estimates that at least 500 million people are affected, and 3 million\\npeople die each year of malaria. Several promising vaccines are in the testing stages.\\nToxoplasmosis: asymptomatic infection in healthy people. Congenital infection: miscarriage or\\nmental retardation, blindness. Reservoirs are cats and grazing animals. Pregnant women\\nmay acquire cysts from cat feces or from ingestion of rare beef or lamb.\\nDiarrhea: ranges from mild to severe; spread by the fecal–oral route. An important cause of\\ndiarrhea in daycare centers and in AIDS patients. Is very resistant to chlorine, may contam-\\ninate municipal water supplies or swimming pools and cause extensive epidemics.\\nBabesiosis: ﬁrst symptoms similar to inﬂuenza; the protozoa reproduce in and destroy RBCs. In\\nsevere cases the hemolytic anemia may lead to renal failure. The vectors are Ixodes ticks.\\nNo vaccine.\\nTable 22–7 INFESTATIONS CAUSED BY WORMS\\nWorm (Genus) Discussion/Disease(s) Caused\\nChinese liver ﬂuke\\n(Clonorchis)\\nTapeworms (Taenia,\\nDiphyllobothrium)\\nPinworm (Enterobius)\\nHookworm (Necator)\\nAscaris\\nTrichinella spiralis\\nAbdominal discomfort; cirrhosis after many years.

People acquire the worms by eat-\\ning poorly cooked beef, pork, or ﬁsh (the alternate hosts) that contain worm cysts.\\nAdult worms (1/8 inch) live in colon; females lay eggs on perianal skin while host is asleep,\\ncausing irritation and itching of skin. Eggs are spread to family members on hands and bed\\nlinens. In the U.S., this is probably the most common worm infestation.\\nAdult worms (1/2 inch) live in the small intestine; their food is blood. Heavy infestations cause\\nanemia and fatigue. Eggs are excreted in feces; larval worms burrow through the skin of a\\nbare foot and migrate to the intestine. Worldwide, in tropical and subtropical regions, an\\nestimated 800 million people are infested. Hookworm is now rare in North America.\\nAdults are 10–12 inches long, and live in the small intestine. Large numbers of worms may\\ncause intestinal obstruction. Eggs are excreted in feces and are spread to others on hands or\\nvegetation contaminated by human feces.\\nTrichinosis: severe muscle pain as migrating worms form cysts that become calciﬁed. Acquired\\nby eating poorly cooked pork (or wild animals) that contains cysts.\\n22Scanlon(p3)-ch22  8/17/06  11:05 AM  Page 523'),\n",

(A step further: What\\nis the stimulus for secretion of each of these\\nhormones?)\\n10–7: Bones are a reservoir for calcium.\\n10–8: Insulin enables cells to take in glucose. The\\nstimulus for insulin secretion is hyper-\\nglycemia, such as after a meal.\\n10–9: Epinephrine causes vasodilation and increases\\ncell respiration in skeletal muscles; norepi-\\nnephrine causes vasoconstriction. (A step fur-\\nther: How does epinephrine increase blood\\npressure?)\\n10–10: Aldosterone directly increases the reabsorp-\\ntion of sodium ions and the excretion of potas-\\nsium ions by the kidneys. (A step further:\\nWhat are the indirect effects of these func-\\ntions of aldosterone?)\\n10–11: Under the stimulus of cortisol, most tissues\\nwill use fats and excess amino acids for energy\\nproduction, and glucose will be stored as\\nglycogen in the liver.\\n10–12: A target cell must have a speciﬁc receptor for\\nthe hormone, either in the cell membrane\\n(protein hormones) or in the cytoplasm\\n(steroid hormones).\\nCHAPTER 11\\n11–1: Blood plasma is mostly water (91.5%); RBCs\\nare the most numerous cells.\\n11–2: Normoblasts and reticulocytes are usually\\nfound in the red bone marrow because they\\nare immature stages of RBC development.\\n(Let’s go a step further: Which cell shown\\nhere is an immature WBC?)\\n11–3: The center of a RBC is pale because it is thin-\\nner than the edge; this is where the nucleus\\nwas.\\n11–4: Iron and amino acids are recycled; the heme of\\nthe hemoglobin is excreted as bilirubin. (A\\nstep further: Where can iron be stored?)\\n11–5: Answers will vary, but if you are type O you\\ncan donate to types A, B, and AB as well as\\ntype O. If you are type A you can donate to\\ntype A or AB, and so on.\\n11–6: The diameter of the arteriole is much larger\\nthan that of the capillary, and platelet plugs\\nwould be washed away before they could\\ncover the opening. Once a fibrin mesh\\nforms, the platelets are trapped, as are RBCs.\\n(A step further: What other mechanism\\nof hemostasis also works in arterioles, and\\nwhy?)\\n29Scanlon(p3) App-G  8/17/06  11:08 AM  Page 542'),\n",

Glucose, however, will not diffuse\\nthrough most cell membranes by itself, even if there is\\nmore outside the cell than inside. Diffusion of glucose\\ninto most cells requires a glucose transporter, which\\nmay also be called a carrier enzyme . These trans-\\nporters are proteins that are part of the cell mem-\\nbrane. Glucose bonds to the transporter (see Fig. 3–3),\\nand by doing so changes the shape of the protein. This\\nphysical change propels the glucose into the interior\\nof the cell. Other transporters are speciﬁc for other\\norganic molecules such as amino acids.\\nACTIVE TRANSPORT\\nActive transport requires the energy of ATP to move\\nmolecules from an area of lesser concentration to an'),\n",

Each type of human cell makes a contribution to\\nthe body as a whole. Usually, however, cells do not\\nfunction as individuals, but rather in groups. Groups\\nof cells with similar structure and function form a tis-\\nsue, which is the next level of organization.\\nCells 63\\nTable 3–4 STAGES OF MITOSIS\\nStage Events\\nProphase\\nMetaphase'),\n",

Then, after delivery of the\\nbaby, prolactin secretion increases and milk is pro-\\nduced. If the mother continues to breast-feed, pro-\\nlactin levels remain high.\\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone\\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is one of the\\ngonadotropic hormones; that is, it has its effects on\\nthe gonads: the ovaries or testes.

By enabling other\\ncells to use the alternative energy sources, cortisol\\nensures that whatever glucose is present will be avail-\\nable to the brain.\\nCortisol also has an anti-inﬂammatory effect .\\nDuring inﬂammation, histamine from damaged tis-\\nsues makes capillaries more permeable, and the lyso-\\nsomes of damaged cells release their enzymes, which\\nhelp break down damaged tissue but may also cause\\ndestruction of nearby healthy tissue. Cortisol blocks\\nthe effects of histamine and stabilizes lysosomal mem-\\nbranes, preventing excessive tissue destruction.\\nInﬂammation is a beneﬁcial process up to a point, and\\nis an essential ﬁrst step if tissue repair is to take place.'),\n",
